"1","Monetary policy decisions","Monetary policy decisions 9 September 2021 Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council judges that favourable financing conditions can be maintained with a moderately lower pace of net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) than in the previous two quarters. The Governing Council also confirmed its other measures, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, its forward guidance on their likely future evolution, its purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), its reinvestment policies and its longer-term refinancing operations. Specifically: Key ECB interest rates The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively. In support of its symmetric two per cent inflation target and in line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it sees inflation reaching two per cent well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at two per cent over the medium term. This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target. Asset purchase programme (APP) Net purchases under the APP will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion. The Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) The Governing Council will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP with a total envelope of €1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council judges that favourable financing conditions can be maintained with a moderately lower pace of net asset purchases under the PEPP than in the previous two quarters. The Governing Council will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation. The Governing Council will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Refinancing operations The Governing Council will continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations. In particular, the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) remains an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households. *** The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its two per cent target over the medium term. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

"4","Monetary policy decisions","Monetary policy decisions 22 July 2021 In its recent strategy review, the Governing Council agreed a symmetric inflation target of two per cent over the medium term. The key ECB interest rates have been close to their lower bound for some time and the medium-term outlook for inflation is still well below the Governing Council’s target. In these conditions, the Governing Council today revised its forward guidance on interest rates. It did so to underline its commitment to maintain a persistently accommodative monetary policy stance to meet its inflation target. In support of its symmetric two per cent inflation target and in line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it sees inflation reaching two per cent well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at two per cent over the medium term. This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target. Having confirmed its June assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council continues to expect purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) over the current quarter to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year. The Governing Council also confirmed its other measures to support its price stability mandate, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, its purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), its reinvestment policies and its longer-term refinancing operations. Specifically: Key ECB interest rates The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.

"5","ECB presents action plan to include climate change considerations in its monetary policy strategy","ECB presents action plan to include climate change considerations in its monetary policy strategy 8 July 2021 The ECB’s Governing Council is strongly committed: to further incorporating climate change considerations into its monetary policy framework; to expanding its analytical capacity in macroeconomic modelling, statistics and monetary policy with regard to climate change; to including climate change considerations in monetary policy operations in the areas of disclosure, risk assessment, collateral framework and corporate sector asset purchases; to implementing the action plan in line with progress on the EU policies and initiatives in the field of environmental sustainability disclosure and reporting. The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided on a comprehensive action plan, with an ambitious roadmap (see annex) to further incorporate climate change considerations into its policy framework. With this decision, the Governing Council underlines its commitment to more systematically reflect environmental sustainability considerations in its monetary policy. The decision follows the conclusion of the strategy review of 2020-21, in which the reflections on climate change and environmental sustainability were of central importance. Addressing climate change is a global challenge and a policy priority for the European Union. While governments and parliaments have the primary responsibility to act on climate change, within its mandate, the ECB recognises the need to further incorporate climate considerations into its policy framework. Climate change and the transition towards a more sustainable economy affect the outlook for price stability through their impact on macroeconomic indicators such as inflation, output, employment, interest rates, investment and productivity; financial stability; and the transmission of monetary policy. Moreover, climate change and the carbon transition affect the value and the risk profile of the assets held on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, potentially leading to an undesirable accumulation of climate-related financial risks. With this action plan, the ECB will increase its contribution to addressing climate change, in line with its obligations under the EU Treaties. The action plan comprises measures that strengthen and broaden ongoing initiatives by the Eurosystem to better account for climate change considerations with the aim of preparing the ground for changes to the monetary policy implementation framework. The design of these measures will be consistent with the price stability objective and should take into account the implications of climate change for an efficient allocation of resources. The recently established ECB climate change centre will coordinate the relevant activities within the ECB, in close cooperation with the Eurosystem. These activities will focus on the following areas: Macroeconomic modelling and assessment of implications for monetary policy transmission. The ECB will accelerate the development of new models and will conduct theoretical and empirical analyses to monitor the implications of climate change and related policies for the economy, the financial system and the transmission of monetary policy through financial markets and the banking system to households and firms. Statistical data for climate change risk analyses. The ECB will develop new experimental indicators, covering relevant green financial instruments and the carbon footprint of financial institutions, as well as their exposures to climate-related physical risks. This will be followed by step-by-step enhancements of such indicators, starting in 2022, also in line with progress on the EU policies and initiatives in the field of environmental sustainability disclosure and reporting. Disclosures as a requirement for eligibility as collateral and asset purchases. The ECB will introduce disclosure requirements for private sector assets as a new eligibility criterion or as a basis for a differentiated treatment for collateral and asset purchases. Such requirements will take into account EU policies and initiatives in the field of environmental sustainability disclosure and reporting and will promote more consistent disclosure practices in the market, while maintaining proportionality through adjusted requirements for small and medium-sized enterprises. The ECB will announce a detailed plan in 2022. Enhancement of risk assessment capabilities. The ECB will start conducting climate stress tests of the Eurosystem balance sheet in 2022 to assess the Eurosystem’s risk exposure to climate change, leveraging on the methodology of the ECB’s economy-wide climate stress test. Furthermore, the ECB will assess whether the credit rating agencies accepted by the Eurosystem Credit Assessment Framework have disclosed the necessary information to understand how they incorporate climate change risks into their credit ratings. In addition, the ECB will consider developing minimum standards for the incorporation of climate change risks into its internal ratings. Collateral framework. The ECB will consider relevant climate change risks when reviewing the valuation and risk control frameworks for assets mobilised as collateral by counterparties for Eurosystem credit operations. This will ensure that they reflect all relevant risks, including those arising from climate change. In addition, the ECB will continue to monitor structural market developments in sustainability products and stands ready to support innovation in the area of sustainable finance within the scope of its mandate, as exemplified by its decision to accept sustainability-linked bonds as collateral (see press release of 22 September 2020). Corporate sector asset purchases. The ECB has already started to take relevant climate change risks into account in its due diligence procedures for its corporate sector asset purchases in its monetary policy portfolios. Looking ahead, the ECB will adjust the framework guiding the allocation of corporate bond purchases to incorporate climate change criteria, in line with its mandate. These will include the alignment of issuers with, at a minimum, EU legislation implementing the Paris agreement through climate change-related metrics or commitments of the issuers to such goals. Furthermore, the ECB will start disclosing climate-related information of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) by the first quarter of 2023 (complementing the disclosures on the non-monetary policy portfolios; see press release of 4 February 2021). The implementation of the action plan will be in line with progress on the EU policies and initiatives in the field of environmental sustainability disclosure and reporting, including the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the Taxonomy Regulation and the Regulation on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector.For media queries, please contact Eva Taylor, tel.: +49 69 1344 7162.

"6","ECB’s Governing Council approves its new monetary policy strategy","ECB’s Governing Council approves its new monetary policy strategy 8 July 2021 New strategy adopts symmetric 2% inflation target over medium term Governing Council confirms that HICP remains appropriate price measure and recommends inclusion of owner-occupied housing over time New monetary policy strategy is result of thorough review launched in January 2020 Governing Council approves ambitious climate change action plan The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has today published its new monetary policy strategy, which it has set out in a monetary policy strategy statement. The Governing Council considers that price stability is best maintained by aiming for a 2% inflation target over the medium term. This target is symmetric, meaning negative and positive deviations of inflation from the target are equally undesirable. When the economy is operating close to the lower bound on nominal interest rates, it requires especially forceful or persistent monetary policy action to avoid negative deviations from the inflation target becoming entrenched. This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target. The Governing Council also confirmed that the set of ECB interest rates remains the primary monetary policy instrument. Other instruments, such as forward guidance, asset purchases and longer-term refinancing operations, that over the past decade have helped mitigate the limitations generated by the lower bound on nominal interest rates will remain an integral part of the ECB’s toolkit, to be used as appropriate. “I am happy to announce that the Governing Council yesterday approved the ECB’s new monetary policy strategy. While taking the ECB’s primary mandate of price stability as a given, the review has allowed us to challenge our thinking, engage with numerous stakeholders, reflect, discuss and reach common ground on how to adapt our strategy. The new strategy is a strong foundation that will guide us in the conduct of monetary policy in the years to come,” said Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB. The Governing Council confirmed that the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) remains the appropriate measure for assessing price stability. However, it recognises that the inclusion of the costs related to owner-occupied housing in the HICP would better represent the inflation relevant for households and that the inclusion of owner-occupied housing in the HICP is a multi-year project. So in the meantime, the Governing Council in its monetary policy assessments will take into account inflation measures that include initial estimates of the cost of owner-occupied housing to supplement its set of broader inflation measures. The Governing Council acknowledged that climate change has profound implications for price stability and, accordingly, it has committed to an ambitious climate-related action plan. A dedicated press release has been published today. The first regular monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council applying the new strategy will be held on 22 July 2021. The Governing Council intends to assess periodically the appropriateness of its monetary policy strategy, with the next assessment expected in 2025. For media queries, please contact Peter Ehrlich, tel.: +49 69 1344 8320. Notes The Governing Council conducted a previous strategy review in 2003. The new strategy that is being announced today follows a thorough review, which was launched on 23 January 2020. Over the last 18 months, the Governing Council has held numerous seminars, presentations, discussions and meetings dedicated to all elements of the review, under the overarching idea of leaving no stone unturned. The current review has drawn on an immense collective effort by staff at the ECB and the national central banks of the euro area, organised in 13 separate work streams. In the framework of the review, the ECB and the national central banks also hosted numerous listening activities with the general public, civil society organisations and academia. Ideas and perspectives shared at these events have fed into the Governing Council’s deliberations.

It was the first in-person meeting of the members of the Governing Council since March 2020. The retreat focused on advancing the discussions about the ECB’s monetary policy strategy review. The topics addressed by the review included, among others, the definition and measurement of price stability, the underlying analytical framework, the medium-term orientation, the role of climate change in formulating monetary policy, and the modernisation of policy communication. “It was good to meet again in-person and the hilly Taunus countryside was ideal to reconnect after months of only digital meetings”, ECB President, Christine Lagarde, said. “I am glad we were able to have in-depth discussions and we made good progress in shaping the concrete features of our future monetary policy strategy at our retreat.” The ECB’s Governing Council will make the outcome of the strategy review public after taking formal decisions.

The Governing Council is of the view that the condition of exceptional circumstances warranting this temporary exclusion from the calculation of banks’ total exposure measure continues to be met for the euro area as a whole. The Governing Council concurs that on a quarterly basis the date on which the exceptional circumstances are deemed to have started is 31 December 2019. Euro area national competent authorities intending to exercise the discretion provided for under Article 429a of the Capital Requirements Regulation in relation to less significant institutions may rely upon this opinion issued by the ECB as monetary authority of the euro area. The opinion of the Governing Council is a precondition for ECB Banking Supervision to allow significant banks in the euro area, which it supervises directly, to exclude certain central bank exposures from the calculation of the leverage ratio.

The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. The Governing Council will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of €1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council expects net purchases under the PEPP over the coming quarter to continue to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year. The Governing Council will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation. The Governing Council will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion. The Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Finally, the Governing Council will continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations. The funding obtained through the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) plays a crucial role in supporting bank lending to firms and households. The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

This operational change will be effective as of 1 July 2021. The auction schedule until 30 June 2021, as already published, remains unchanged. From 1 July 2021 onwards, these central banks will continue to hold weekly operations with a 7-day maturity. These central banks stand ready to re-adjust the provision of US dollar liquidity, including restarting the 84-day operation, as warranted by market conditions. The swap lines among these central banks are available standing facilities and serve as an important liquidity backstop to ease strains in global funding markets, thereby helping to mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses, both domestically and abroad.

The central banks of Albania, Croatia, Hungary, the Republic of North Macedonia, Romania, San Marino and Serbia have agreed to extend the duration of their euro liquidity lines with the ECB to March 2022. The lines were established earlier in 2020 to provide euro liquidity to financial institutions in the respective countries via the corresponding national central banks. The objective of these euro liquidity lines is to address possible euro liquidity needs in non-euro area countries in the presence of market dysfunctions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, they aim at preventing spillback effects on euro area financial markets and economies that might adversely impact the smooth transmission of ECB monetary policy. The temporary euro liquidity lines had previously been set to expire in June 2021. Through a swap line agreement, Hrvatska narodna banka (Croatian National Bank) can borrow up to €2 billion from the ECB in exchange for Croatian kuna. Under their respective repo line agreements: Banka e Shqipërisë (Bank of Albania) can borrow up to €400 million from the ECB Magyar Nemzeti Bank can borrow up to €4 billion from the ECB Народна банка на Република Северна Македонија (National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia) can borrow up to €400 million from the ECB Banca Naţională a României (National Bank of Romania) can borrow up to €4.5 billion from the ECB Banca Centrale della Repubblica di San Marino (Central Bank of the Republic of San Marino) can borrow up to €100 million from the ECB Народна банка Србије (National Bank of Serbia) can borrow up to €1 billion from the ECB Under a repo line, central banks can borrow euro up to the specified limit in exchange for adequate euro-denominated collateral.

Additional operations provide liquidity backstop to preserve the smooth functioning of the money market during the extended pandemic period. The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to offer four additional pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) on a quarterly basis during 2021. Each operation will have a tenor of approximately one year. These operations will serve as a liquidity backstop to the euro area banking system and contribute to preserving the smooth functioning of money markets during the extended pandemic period. The PELTROs will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The operations will be offered at accommodative terms. The interest rate will be 25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations (currently 0%) over the life of the respective PELTRO. The PELTROs will be conducted in accordance with the indicative calendar shown below.

"18","Monetary policy decisions","Monetary policy decisions 10 December 2020 In view of the economic fallout from the resurgence of the pandemic, today the Governing Council recalibrated its monetary policy instruments as follows: First, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 per cent within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. Second, the Governing Council decided to increase the envelope of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by €500 billion to a total of €1,850 billion. It also extended the horizon for net purchases under the PEPP to at least the end of March 2022. In any case, the Governing Council will conduct net purchases until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. The Governing Council also decided to extend the reinvestment of principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Third, the Governing Council decided to further recalibrate the conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). Specifically, it decided to extend the period over which considerably more favourable terms will apply by twelve months, to June 2022. Three additional operations will also be conducted between June and December 2021. Moreover, the Governing Council decided to raise the total amount that counterparties will be entitled to borrow in TLTRO III operations from 50 per cent to 55 per cent of their stock of eligible loans. In order to provide an incentive for banks to sustain the current level of bank lending, the recalibrated TLTRO III borrowing conditions will be made available only to banks that achieve a new lending performance target. Fourth, the Governing Council decided to extend to June 2022 the duration of the set of collateral easing measures adopted by the Governing Council on 7 and 22 April 2020. The extension of these measures will continue to ensure that banks can make full use of the Eurosystem’s liquidity operations, most notably the recalibrated TLTROs. The Governing Council will reassess the collateral easing measures before June 2022, ensuring that Eurosystem counterparties’ participation in TLTRO III operations is not adversely affected. Fifth, the Governing Council also decided to offer four additional pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) in 2021, which will continue to provide an effective liquidity backstop. Sixth, net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion. The Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Seventh, the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP) and all temporary swap and repo lines with non-euro area central banks will be extended until March 2022. Finally, the Governing Council decided to continue conducting its regular lending operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment at the prevailing conditions for as long as necessary. Separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the Governing Council will be published this afternoon at 15:30 CET. The monetary policy measures taken today will contribute to preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period, thereby supporting the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy, underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability. At the same time, uncertainty remains high, including with regard to the dynamics of the pandemic and the timing of vaccine roll-outs. We will also continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate with regard to their possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. The Governing Council therefore continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

"19","Monetary policy decisions","Monetary policy decisions 29 October 2020 In the current environment of risks clearly tilted to the downside, the Governing Council will carefully assess the incoming information, including the dynamics of the pandemic, prospects for a rollout of vaccines and developments in the exchange rate. The new round of Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections in December will allow a thorough reassessment of the economic outlook and the balance of risks. On the basis of this updated assessment, the Governing Council will recalibrate its instruments, as appropriate, to respond to the unfolding situation and to ensure that financing conditions remain favourable to support the economic recovery and counteract the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path. This will foster the convergence of inflation towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. In the meantime, the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions: (1) The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. (2) The Governing Council will continue its purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of €1,350 billion. These purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary policy stance, thereby helping to offset the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This allows the Governing Council to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy. The Governing Council will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of June 2021 and, in any case, until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. The Governing Council will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2022. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. (3) Net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. The Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. (4) The Governing Council will also continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations. In particular, the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) remains an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

The amended guidelines implement a decision taken by the Governing Council on 13 December 2019 whereby secured marketable assets other than asset-backed securities and covered bonds would no longer be accepted as Eurosystem collateral. Under the amended guidelines, the ECB will also phase out non-legislative covered bonds (i.e. contractual covered bonds) from the Eurosystem collateral framework. This means that by 1 January 2021 all covered bonds remaining in the collateral framework will be legislative covered bonds or multi-cédulas. The guidelines also clarify the application process and acceptance criteria for external credit assessment institutions in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework. They furthermore amend the Eurosystem monetary policy counterparty framework with respect to the treatment of confirmed breaches of minimum own funds requirements and breaches of the obligation to report information on capital ratios within the required deadlines. Guidelines ECB/2020/45, ECB/2020/46, ECB/2020/47 and Decision ECB/2020/48 are available on the ECB’s website and will be published in 23 official EU languages in the Official Journal of the European Union.

The coupons must be linked to a performance target referring to one or more of the environmental objectives set out in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and/or to one or more of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals relating to climate change or environmental degradation. This further broadens the universe of Eurosystem-eligible marketable assets and signals the Eurosystem’s support for innovation in the area of sustainable finance. Non-marketable assets with comparable coupon structures are already eligible. The decision aligns the treatment of marketable and non-marketable collateral assets with such coupon structures. The decision applies from 1 January 2021. For media queries, please contact Eva Taylor, tel.: +49 69 1344 7162.

"23","ECB’s Governing Council says that exceptional circumstances justify leverage ratio relief","ECB’s Governing Council says that exceptional circumstances justify leverage ratio relief 17 September 2020 ECB’s Governing Council confirms exceptional circumstances Opinion instrumental in ECB Banking Supervision’s decision to allow banks to exclude central bank exposures from leverage ratio See also ECB Banking Supervision announcement on leverage ratio The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided that it concurs with ECB Banking supervision that there are ‘exceptional circumstances’ allowing the temporary exclusion of certain central bank exposures from the leverage ratio. The Governing Council said in an opinion: “The situation brought about by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected all euro area economies in an unprecedented and profound way. This situation has resulted in an ongoing need for a high degree of monetary policy accommodation, which in turn requires the undeterred functioning of the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy. In the view of the Governing Council, therefore, the condition of exceptional circumstances warranting the temporary exclusion of certain exposures to central banks from the calculation of banks’ total exposure measures is met for the euro area as a whole. Euro area national competent authorities which intend to exercise the discretion provided for under Article 500b(2) of the CRR in relation to less significant institutions may rely upon this opinion issued by the ECB as monetary authority of the euro area.” This opinion of the Governing Council is a precondition for ECB Banking Supervision to allow significant banks that it directly supervises to exclude certain central bank exposures from the leverage ratio. Such assets include coins and banknotes as well as deposits held at the central bank. For media queries, please contact William Lelieveldt, tel.: +49 69 1344 7316.

The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. (4) The Governing Council will also continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations. In particular, the latest operation in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) has registered a very high take-up of funds, supporting bank lending to firms and households. The Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

"32","New Eurosystem repo facility to provide euro liquidity to non-euro area central banks ","25 June 2020 New Eurosystem repo facility to provide euro liquidity to non-euro area central banks Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP) introduced as precautionary backstop to address pandemic-related euro liquidity needs outside euro area EUREP to allow broad set of central banks to borrow euro against euro-denominated debt issued by euro area central governments and supranational institutions New facility to be available until June 2021 In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to set up a new backstop facility, called the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP), to provide precautionary euro repo lines to central banks outside the euro area. EUREP addresses possible euro liquidity needs in case of market dysfunction resulting from the COVID-19 shock that might adversely impact the smooth transmission of ECB monetary policy. Under EUREP, the Eurosystem will provide euro liquidity to a broad set of central banks outside the euro area against adequate collateral, consisting of euro-denominated marketable debt securities issued by euro area central governments and supranational institutions. EUREP complements the ECB’s bilateral swap and repo lines and reflects the importance of the euro in global financial markets. EUREP will be available until the end of June 2021.

"37","Monetary policy decisions","4 June 2020 Monetary policy decisions At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions: (1) The envelope for the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) will be increased by €600 billion to a total of €1,350 billion. In response to the pandemic-related downward revision to inflation over the projection horizon, the PEPP expansion will further ease the general monetary policy stance, supporting funding conditions in the real economy, especially for businesses and households. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This allows the Governing Council to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy. (2) The horizon for net purchases under the PEPP will be extended to at least the end of June 2021. In any case, the Governing Council will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. (3) The maturing principal payments from securities purchased under the PEPP will be reinvested until at least the end of 2022. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary stance. (4) Net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. The Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. (5) Reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP will continue, in full, for an extended period of time past the date when the Governing Council starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. (6) The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. The Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

"38","ECB announces new pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations ","30 April 2020 ECB announces new pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations Series of additional longer-term refinancing operations to ensure sufficient liquidity and smooth money market conditions during the pandemic period Operations allotted on a near monthly basis maturing in the third quarter of 2021 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to conduct a new series of seven additional longer-term refinancing operations, called pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs). These operations will provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system and contribute to preserving the smooth functioning of money markets by providing an effective backstop after the expiry of the bridge longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) that have been conducted since March 2020. Counterparties participating in PELTROs will be able to benefit from the collateral easing measures in place until the end of September 2021 that were announced by the Governing Council on 7 and 23 April 2020. The PELTROs will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The operations will be offered at highly accommodative terms. The interest rate will be 25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations (currently 0%) over the life of the respective PELTRO. The PELTROs will be conducted according to the indicative calendar below. The first operation will be announced on 19 May, allotted on 20 May and settled on 21 May 2020. The operations provide longer-term funding to counterparties with decreasing tenors, starting with a tenor of 16 months in the first operation and ending with a tenor of 8 months in the last operation. The ECB stands ready to provide additional liquidity, if needed.

"39","ECB recalibrates targeted lending operations to further support real economy","30 April 2020 ECB recalibrates targeted lending operations to further support real economy Interest rate on all targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) reduced by 25 basis points to -0.5% from June 2020 to June 2021 For banks meeting the lending threshold of 0% introduced on 12 March 2020, the interest rate can be as low as -1% Start of the lending assessment period brought forward to 1 March 2020 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided on a number of modifications to the terms and conditions of its targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) in order to support further the provision of credit to households and firms in the face of the current economic disruption and heightened uncertainty. For the period from 24 June 2020 to 23 June 2021 the interest rate on all TLTRO III operations will now be 50 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations over the same period. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations is currently 0%. For counterparties whose eligible net lending reaches the lending performance threshold, the interest rate applied from 24 June 2020 to 23 June 2021 on all TLTRO III operations will be 50 basis points below the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the same period, and in any case not higher than -1%. The deposit facility rate is currently -0.5%. The start of the period over which banks’ lending performance will be assessed in order to ascertain whether they qualify for this lower rate will be brought forward to 1 March 2020, from 1 April 2020, while the end of the assessment period will remain unchanged at 31 March 2021. This adjustment recognises the funding support that banks have already provided to firms in March at the start of the crisis related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, in line with the aims of TLTRO III. For banks that reach the lending threshold of 0% between 1 March 2020 and 31 March 2021, the most favourable conditions will be applied throughout the entire life of the operations. The interest rate applied before 24 June 2020 and after 23 June 2021 for these counterparties will be the average interest rate on the deposit facility over the life of the respective operation. For banks that do not reach the lending threshold of 0% between 1 March 2020 and 31 March 2021, the original TLTRO III interest rates and lending threshold, evaluated over the longer period of between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2021, will apply. For these counterparties, in recognition of the challenging credit environment during the pandemic period, the lending threshold that they need to meet over this longer assessment period will be lowered to 1.15%, from 2.5%. In any case, during the period from 24 June 2020 to 23 June 2021 the rate for these banks will not be higher than 50 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations over the same period. The changes to TLTRO III will apply to all TLTRO III operations and will be implemented via amendments to the Decision of the ECB of 22 July 2019 on a third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (ECB/2019/21), as amended by the Decisions of the ECB of 12 September 2019 (ECB/2019/28) and 16 March 2020 (ECB/2020/13). The changes to the lending threshold, the reduction in the rates during the period from 24 June 2020 to 23 June 2021 and the bringing forward of the start date of the lending performance assessment period to 1 March 2020 will be set forth in a third amendment that will be published shortly on the ECB’s website and subsequently in the Official Journal of the European Union. For media queries, please contact Stefan Ruhkamp, tel.: +49 69 1344 5057. Notes The ECB announced TLTRO III on 7 March 2019 and details on 6 June 2019. It announced changes to TLTRO III on 12 September 2019 and an easing of the conditions on 12 March 2020. Further information on TLTRO I, TLTRO II and TLTRO III can be found on the ECB’s website.

"40","Monetary policy decisions","30 April 2020 Monetary policy decisions At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions: (1) The conditions on the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) have been further eased. Specifically, the Governing Council decided to reduce the interest rate on TLTRO III operations during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 to 50 basis points below the average interest rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations prevailing over the same period. Moreover, for counterparties whose eligible net lending reaches the lending performance threshold, the interest rate over the period from June 2020 to June 2021 will now be 50 basis points below the average deposit facility rate prevailing over the same period. (2) A new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) will be conducted to support liquidity conditions in the euro area financial system and contribute to preserving the smooth functioning of money markets by providing an effective liquidity backstop. The PELTROs consist of seven additional refinancing operations commencing in May 2020 and maturing in a staggered sequence between July and September 2021 in line with the duration of the collateral easing measures. They will be carried out as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment, with an interest rate that is 25 basis points below the average rate on the main refinancing operations prevailing over the life of each PELTRO. (3) Since the end of March, purchases have been conducted under the Governing Council’s new pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which has an overall envelope of €750 billion, to ease the overall monetary policy stance and to counter the severe risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the outlook for the euro area posed by the coronavirus pandemic. These purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. The Governing Council will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over, but in any case until the end of this year. (4) Moreover, net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. The Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. (5) Reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP will continue, in full, for an extended period of time past the date when the Governing Council starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. (6) The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. The Governing Council is fully prepared to increase the size of the PEPP and adjust its composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed. In any case, it stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. Further details on the amendments made to the terms of TLTRO III and on the new PELTROs will be published in dedicated press releases this afternoon at 15:30 CET. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

"41","ECB takes steps to mitigate impact of possible rating downgrades on collateral availability ","22 April 2020 ECB takes steps to mitigate impact of possible rating downgrades on collateral availability ECB to grandfather until September 2021 eligibility of marketable assets used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations falling below current minimum credit quality requirements Appropriate haircuts will apply for assets that fall below the Eurosystem minimum credit quality requirements Decision reinforces broader package of collateral easing measures adopted by the Governing Council on 7 April 2020, which will also remain in place until September 2021 ECB may decide further measures, if needed, to continue ensuring the smooth transmission of its monetary policy in all jurisdictions of the euro area The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today adopted temporary measures to mitigate the effect on collateral availability of possible rating downgrades resulting from the economic fallout from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The decision complements the broader collateral easing package that was announced on 7 April 2020. Together these measures aim to ensure that banks have sufficient assets that they can mobilise as collateral with the Eurosystem to participate in the liquidity-providing operations and to continue providing funding to the euro area economy. Specifically, the Governing Council decided to grandfather the eligibility of marketable assets and the issuers of such assets that fulfilled minimum credit quality requirements on 7 April 2020 in the event of a deterioration in credit ratings decided by the credit rating agencies accepted in the Eurosystem as long as the ratings remain above a certain credit quality level. By doing so, the Governing Council aims to avoid potential procyclical dynamics. This would ensure continued collateral availability, which is crucial for banks to provide funding to firms and households during the current challenging times. The following decisions have been taken: Marketable assets and issuers of these assets that met the minimum credit quality requirements for collateral eligibility on 7 April 2020 (BBB- for all assets, except asset-backed securities (ABSs)) will continue to be eligible in case of rating downgrades, as long as their rating remains at or above credit quality step 5 (CQS5, equivalent to a rating of BB) on the Eurosystem harmonised rating scale. This ensures that assets and issuers that were investment grade at the time the Governing Council adopted the package of collateral easing measures remain eligible even if their rating falls two notches below the current minimum credit quality requirement of the Eurosystem. To be grandfathered, the assets need to continue to fulfil all other existing collateral eligibility criteria. Future issuances from grandfathered issuers will also be eligible provided they fulfil all other collateral eligibility criteria. Currently eligible covered bond programmes will also be grandfathered, under the same conditions. Currently eligible ABSs to which a rating threshold in the general framework of CQS2 applies (equivalent to a rating of A-) will be grandfathered as long as their rating remains at or above CQS4 (equivalent to a rating of BB+). Assets that fall below the minimum credit quality requirements will be subject to haircuts based on their actual ratings. Non-marketable assets are not part of the scope of the temporary grandfathering. All measures will enter into effect as soon as the relevant legal acts enter into force. The measures will apply until September 2021 when the first early repayment of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) takes place. The same end date will also apply to the collateral easing measures announced on 7 April 2020. The ECB may decide, if and when necessary, to take additional measures to further mitigate the impact of rating downgrades, particularly with a view to ensuring the smooth transmission of its monetary policy in all jurisdictions of the euro area.

"44","ECB announces package of temporary collateral easing measures","7 April 2020 ECB announces package of temporary collateral easing measures ECB adopts an unprecedented set of collateral measures to mitigate the tightening of financial conditions across the euro area Temporary increase in the Eurosystem’s risk tolerance in order to support credit to the economy ECB eases the conditions for the use of credit claims as collateral ECB adopts a general reduction of collateral valuation haircuts Waiver to accept Greek sovereign debt instruments as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations ECB will assess further measures to temporarily mitigate the effect on counterparties’ collateral availability from rating downgrades The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today adopted a package of temporary collateral easing measures to facilitate the availability of eligible collateral for Eurosystem counterparties to participate in liquidity providing operations, such as the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III). The package is complementary to other measures recently announced by the ECB, including additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) as a response to the coronavirus emergency. The measures collectively support the provision of bank lending especially by easing the conditions at which credit claims are accepted as collateral. At the same time the Eurosystem is increasing its risk tolerance to support the provision of credit via its refinancing operations, particularly by lowering collateral valuation haircuts for all assets consistently. The emergency collateral package contains three main features. First, the Governing Council decided on a set of collateral measures to facilitate an increase in bank funding against loans to corporates and households. This will be achieved by expanding the use of credit claims as collateral, in particular through the potential expansion of the additional credit claims (ACCs) frameworks. The ACC framework provides the possibility to National Central Banks to enlarge the scope of eligible credit claims for counterparties in their jurisdictions. This includes the possibility to accept loans with lower credit quality, loans to other types of debtors, not accepted in the ECB’s general framework, and foreign-currency loans. In this respect, the Governing Council decided to temporarily extend the ACC frameworks further by: Accommodating the requirements on guarantees to include government and public sector guaranteed loans to corporates, SMEs and self-employed individuals and households in the ACC frameworks in order to also provide liquidity against loans benefiting from the new guarantee schemes adopted in euro area Member States as a response to the coronavirus pandemic; Enlarging the scope of acceptable credit assessment systems used in the ACC frameworks, for example by easing the acceptance of banks’ own credit assessments from internal rating-based systems that are approved by supervisors; Reducing the ACC loan level reporting requirements to allow counterparties to benefit from the ACC frameworks even before the necessary reporting infrastructure is put in place. Second, the Governing Council further adopted the following temporary measures: A lowering of the level of the non-uniform minimum size threshold for domestic credit claims to EUR 0 from EUR 25,000 previously to facilitate the mobilisation as collateral of loans from small corporate entities; An increase, from 2.5% to 10%, in the maximum share of unsecured debt instruments issued by any single other banking group in a credit institution’s collateral pool. This will enable counterparties to benefit from a larger share of such assets. A waiver of the minimum credit quality requirement for marketable debt instruments issued by the Hellenic Republic for acceptance as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations. Third, the Governing Council decided to temporarily increase its risk tolerance level in credit operations through a general reduction of collateral valuation haircuts by a fixed factor of 20%. This adjustment aims to contribute to the collateral easing measures while maintaining a consistent degree of protection across collateral asset types, albeit at a temporarily lower level. These measures are temporary for the duration of the pandemic crisis and linked to the duration of the PEPP. They will be re-assessed before the end of 2020, also considering whether there is a need to extend some of these measures to ensure that Eurosystem counterparties’ participation in its liquidity providing operations is not adversely affected. In addition, as part of the regular review of its risk control framework, the Governing Council decided to adjust the haircuts applied to non-marketable assets, both in the general collateral framework and for ACCs, by fine-tuning some of the haircut parameters. This adjustment, which is not linked to the duration of the PEPP, applies in addition to the temporary haircut reduction and thus further supports the collateral easing measures while maintaining adequate risk protection. This leads on average to a further haircut reduction of this type of collateral by around 20%. Furthermore, the Governing Council has mandated the Eurosystem committees to assess measures to temporarily mitigate the effect on counterparties’ collateral availability from rating downgrades arising from the economic impact of coronavirus, while continuing ensuring collateral adequacy.

"47","ECB announces €750 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP)","18 March 2020 ECB announces €750 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) The Governing Council decided the following: (1) To launch a new temporary asset purchase programme of private and public sector securities to counter the serious risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the outlook for the euro area posed by the outbreak and escalating diffusion of the coronavirus, COVID-19. This new Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) will have an overall envelope of €750 billion. Purchases will be conducted until the end of 2020 and will include all the asset categories eligible under the existing asset purchase programme (APP). For the purchases of public sector securities, the benchmark allocation across jurisdictions will continue to be the capital key of the national central banks. At the same time, purchases under the new PEPP will be conducted in a flexible manner. This allows for fluctuations in the distribution of purchase flows over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. A waiver of the eligibility requirements for securities issued by the Greek government will be granted for purchases under PEPP. The Governing Council will terminate net asset purchases under PEPP once it judges that the coronavirus Covid-19 crisis phase is over, but in any case not before the end of the year. (2) To expand the range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) to non-financial commercial paper, making all commercial papers of sufficient credit quality eligible for purchase under CSPP. (3) To ease the collateral standards by adjusting the main risk parameters of the collateral framework. In particular, we will expand the scope of Additional Credit Claims (ACC) to include claims related to the financing of the corporate sector. This will ensure that counterparties can continue to make full use of the Eurosystem’s refinancing operations. The Governing Council of the ECB is committed to playing its role in supporting all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. To that end, the ECB will ensure that all sectors of the economy can benefit from supportive financing conditions that enable them to absorb this shock. This applies equally to families, firms, banks and governments. The Governing Council will do everything necessary within its mandate. The Governing Council is fully prepared to increase the size of its asset purchase programmes and adjust their composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed. It will explore all options and all contingencies to support the economy through this shock. To the extent that some self-imposed limits might hamper action that the ECB is required to take in order to fulfil its mandate, the Governing Council will consider revising them to the extent necessary to make its action proportionate to the risks that we face. The ECB will not tolerate any risks to the smooth transmission of its monetary policy in all jurisdictions of the euro area.

The changes will apply to all TLTRO III operations. For the period from 24 June 2020 to 23 June 2021, the interest rate on all TLTRO III operations outstanding during that time will be 25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations over the same period. From 24 June 2020 to 23 June 2021, for counterparties whose eligible net lending between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021 reaches the benchmark, the interest rate applied on all TLTRO III operations outstanding over that period will be 25 basis points below the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the same period, and in any case not higher than -0.75%. The maximum total amount that counterparties will henceforth be entitled to borrow is raised from 30% to 50% of their stock of eligible loans as at 28 February 2019 for all future TLTRO III operations. The amount counterparties can borrow under future TLTRO III operations is reduced by any amount that they previously borrowed under TLTRO II or TLTRO III that is still outstanding. The limit of 10% of the stock of eligible loans for the amount of funds that can be borrowed in each operation is removed on all future operations. In view of the changing economic environment, the lending performance threshold that needs to be met in the period between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021 in order to attain the minimum interest rate on TLTRO III operations has been lowered to 0%, from 2.5%. The option for counterparties to repay the amounts borrowed under TLTRO III earlier than their final maturity will now be available one year from the settlement of each operation, instead of two years, starting in September 2021. The changes to TLTRO III are accompanied by a series of LTROs designed to bridge liquidity needs and support the normal functioning of the euro money market until the settlement of the fourth TLTRO III operation on 24 June 2020. A separate press release provides details. These changes will apply as of the TLTRO III operation to be allotted on 19 March 2020 and will be implemented via amendments to the Decision of the ECB of 22 July 2019 on a third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (ECB/2019/21), as amended by the Decision of the ECB of 12 September 2019 (ECB/2019/28). The first amendment, to be published by 16 March 2020, will concern modifications to the borrowing allowance and the bid limits per operation. The second amendment, to be published before the fourth TLTRO III operation, will concern the lending performance threshold, the temporary reduction in rates applied to all TLTRO III operations outstanding during the period from 24 June 2020 to 23 June 2021, as well as further aspects.

"51","Monetary policy decisions","12 March 2020 Monetary policy decisions At today’s meeting the Governing Council decided on a comprehensive package of monetary policy measures: (1) Additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) will be conducted, temporarily, to provide immediate liquidity support to the euro area financial system. Although the Governing Council does not see material signs of strains in money markets or liquidity shortages in the banking system, these operations will provide an effective backstop in case of need. They will be carried out through a fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment, with an interest rate that is equal to the average rate on the deposit facility. The LTROs will provide liquidity at favourable terms to bridge the period until the TLTRO III operation in June 2020. (2) In TLTRO III, considerably more favourable terms will be applied during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 to all TLTRO III operations outstanding during that same time. These operations will support bank lending to those affected most by the spread of the coronavirus, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises. Throughout this period, the interest rate on these TLTRO III operations will be 25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations. For counterparties that maintain their levels of credit provision, the rate applied in these operations will be lower, and, over the period ending in June 2021, can be as low as 25 basis points below the average interest rate on the deposit facility. Moreover, the maximum total amount that counterparties will henceforth be entitled to borrow in TLTRO III operations is raised to 50% of their stock of eligible loans as at 28 February 2019. In this context, the Governing Council will mandate the Eurosystem committees to investigate collateral easing measures to ensure that counterparties continue to be able to make full use of the funding support. (3) A temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of €120 billion will be added until the end of the year, ensuring a strong contribution from the private sector purchase programmes. In combination with the existing asset purchase programme (APP), this will support favourable financing conditions for the real economy in times of heightened uncertainty. The Governing Council continues to expect net asset purchases to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. (4) The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. (5) Reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP will continue, in full, for an extended period of time past the date when the Governing Council starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Further details on the precise terms of the new operations will be published in dedicated press releases this afternoon at 15:30 CET. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

"52","ECB welcomes ratification of agreement on orderly UK withdrawal from European Union","ECB welcomes ratification of agreement on orderly UK withdrawal from European Union 30 January 2020 ECB regrets United Kingdom leaving European Union Central bank prepared for all contingencies, and monitoring financial market developments Banks now need to press ahead with implementation of Brexit plans The European Central Bank (ECB) expressed regret that the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. However, the ECB welcomes the ratification of the agreement on an orderly UK withdrawal. In recent months and years, the ECB has taken steps to prepare for all contingencies and it will continue to closely monitor developments in financial markets to preserve stability. The ECB stresses that banks now need to press ahead with the implementation of their Brexit plans in accordance with agreed timelines. The ECB’s President, Christine Lagarde, said: “It is with great regret that we see our British friends leave the European Union. This agreement, however, will pave the way for an orderly and less disruptive departure. We will work hard to ensure Brexit causes as little disruption as possible for the citizens, employers and financial markets in the euro area and the rest of the EU.” Specifically, the ECB has made the following preparations: The ECB and the Bank of England activated a currency swap arrangement in March 2019, through which the Bank of England offers to lend euros to UK banks on a weekly basis. As part of the same agreement, the Eurosystem would stand ready to lend pounds sterling to euro area banks if the need arises. This will reduce possible sources of stress in the financial system. In banking supervision, the ECB processed around 25 licensing procedures for banks relocating to the euro area and assessed the Brexit plans of 42 euro area banks that will maintain their UK branches after the United Kingdom leaves the EU. The ECB now expects banks to implement their plans in line with the commitments they made in the past – including the implementation timelines they agreed with their supervisors. The ECB and its UK counterparts have taken steps to ensure continued good cooperation in the area of banking supervision, also after the transition period ends. For this, a memorandum of understanding was agreed that will allow supervisors to continue exchanging information and to coordinate the supervision of cross-border banking groups. The Bank of England will leave the European System of Central Banks. The Bank of England’s current share in the ECB’s subscribed capital, which stands at 14.3%, will be reallocated among both the euro area national central banks (NCBs) and the remaining non-euro area NCBs on the basis of an updated key for subscription to the ECB’s capital. A separate press release has been issued. For media queries, please contact William Lelieveldt, tel.: +49 69 1344 7316.

"53","Euro banknote counterfeiting remained low in the second half of 2019","Euro banknote counterfeiting remained low in the second half of 2019 24 January 2020 308,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in the second half of 2019 Over 70% of those counterfeits were €20 and €50 banknotes Euro banknotes continue to be a trusted and safe means of payment All euro banknotes can be verified using the “feel, look and tilt” method Some 308,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in the second half of 2019, an increase of 22.7% when compared with the first half of 2019 and 17.6% more than in the second half of 2018. The likelihood of receiving a counterfeit is very small indeed as the number of counterfeits remains very low compared with the number of genuine banknotes in circulation, which has risen steadily at rates in excess of GDP growth since they were first introduced (see the data on euro banknotes in circulation). The number of counterfeits detected annually per 1 million genuine banknotes in circulation is at a very low level (see the chart below). There are around 24 billion euro banknotes in circulation, with a total value of close to €1.3 trillion. Number of counterfeits detected annually per 1 million genuine notes in circulation Half-yearly figures: Period H2 2016 H1 2017 H2 2017 H1 2018 H2 2018 H1 2019 H2 2019 Number of counterfeits 353,000 331,000 363,000 301,000 262,000 251,000 308,000 Breakdown by denomination for the second half of 2019: Denomination €5 €10 €20 €50 €100 €200 €500 Percentage of total 2.4% 13.5% 34.2% 36.5% 9.6% 1.4% 2.4% In the second half of 2019: The €20 and €50 notes continued to be the most counterfeited banknotes, jointly accounting for over 70% of all counterfeits. Most counterfeits (96.4%) were found in euro area countries. The rest were found in non-euro area EU Member States (3.0%) and in other parts of the world (0.6%). Check your banknotes! There has been an increase in the number of low quality counterfeits withdrawn from circulation. All are easy to detect as they have very poor imitations of security features. Using counterfeits for payments is a criminal offence that may lead to prosecution. Ever since the first series of euro banknotes was issued, the Eurosystem – i.e. the European Central Bank (ECB) and the 19 national central banks of the euro area – has encouraged people to be vigilant when receiving banknotes. You can check your notes by using the simple “feel, look and tilt” method described in the ""The €uro"" section of the ECB’s website and on the websites of the national central banks. If you receive a suspect banknote, compare it directly with one you know to be genuine. If your suspicions are confirmed please contact the police or – depending on national practice – your national central bank or your own retail or commercial bank. The Eurosystem supports law enforcement agencies in their fight against currency counterfeiting. The Eurosystem communicates in various ways to help people distinguish between genuine and counterfeit notes, as well as to help professional cash handlers ensure that banknote-handling and processing machines can reliably identify counterfeits and withdraw them from circulation. The Eurosystem has a duty to safeguard the integrity of euro banknotes and to continue improving banknote technology. The second series of banknotes – the Europa series – is even more secure and is helping to maintain public trust in the currency.

"57","ECB introduces two-tier system for remunerating excess liquidity holdings","12 September 2019 ECB introduces two-tier system for remunerating excess liquidity holdings Two-tier system aims to support bank-based transmission of monetary policy Part of excess liquidity holdings exempt from negative deposit facility rate Scheme to apply as of seventh maintenance period starting on 30 October 2019 Exempt tier will be remunerated at the annual rate of 0% The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to introduce a two-tier system for reserve remuneration, which exempts part of credit institutions’ excess liquidity holdings (i.e. reserve holdings in excess of minimum reserve requirements) from negative remuneration at the rate applicable on the deposit facility. This decision aims to support the bank-based transmission of monetary policy, while preserving the positive contribution of negative rates to the accommodative stance of monetary policy and to the continued sustained convergence of inflation to the ECB’s aim. All credit institutions subject to minimum reserve requirements under Regulation ECB/2003/9 will be eligible for the two-tier system. The two-tier system will apply to excess liquidity held in current accounts with the Eurosystem but will not apply to holdings at the ECB’s deposit facility. The volume of reserve holdings in excess of minimum reserve requirements that will be exempt from the deposit facility rate – the exempt tier – will be determined as a multiple of an institution’s minimum reserve requirements. The multiplier will be the same for all institutions. The Governing Council will set the multiplier such that euro short-term money market rates are not unduly influenced. The multiplier may be adjusted by the Governing Council in line with changing levels of excess liquidity holdings. Any adjustment to the multiplier will be announced and will apply as of the following maintenance period after such decision is made. The size of the exempt tier is determined on the basis of average end-of-calendar-day balances in the institutions’ reserve accounts over a maintenance period. The exempt tier of excess liquidity holdings will be remunerated at an annual rate of 0%. The non-exempt tier of excess liquidity holdings will continue to be remunerated at zero percent or the deposit facility rate, whichever is lower. The two-tier system will first be applied in the seventh maintenance period of 2019 starting on 30 October 2019. The multiplier that will be applicable as of that maintenance period will be set at 6. The remuneration rate of the exempt tier and the multiplier can be changed over time. For media queries, please contact Stefan Ruhkamp, tel.: +49 69 1344 5057. Notes: The ECB has published explanations of minimum reserves and the deposit facility rate. Further information on minimum reserves can be found in Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 of the ECB of 12 September 2003 on the application of minimum reserves (ECB/2003/9), OJ L 250, 2.10.2003, p. 10.

"58","ECB announces changes to new targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III)","ECB announces changes to new targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) 12 September 2019 Interest rate on TLTRO III operations to be reduced Rate can be as low as the average interest rate on deposit facility Maturity extended to three years, from two years, with repayment option after two years The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to modify some of the key parameters of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) to preserve favourable bank lending conditions, ensure the smooth functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy. First, in terms of the pricing of TLTRO III, the previously announced 10-basis point spread above the average interest rate of the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations (MROs) and, for counterparties exceeding their lending benchmark, above the average interest rate on the deposit facility, will no longer be applied. The interest rate for TLTRO III will therefore be equal to the average rate applied to the Eurosystem’s MROs over the life of the respective TLTRO III operation. For counterparties whose eligible net lending between the end of March 2019 and the end of March 2021 exceeds their benchmark net lending, the rate applied to TLTRO III operations will be lower, and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the respective TLTRO III operation. This adjustment in the pricing of TLTRO III will enhance the effectiveness of the operations by increasing the support they provide to bank funding conditions, so that banks may continue to lend to firms and households on favourable terms. Second, the maturity of TLTRO III operations has been extended to three years as of their settlement date. This longer maturity is better aligned with that of bank loans used to finance investment projects and thereby enhances the support that the operations will provide to the financing of the real economy, in view of the deterioration in the economic outlook since the maturity was originally announced in March 2019. Third, following the extension of the maturity of TLTRO III operations, counterparties will be able to repay the amounts borrowed under TLTRO III earlier than their final maturity, at a quarterly frequency starting two years after the settlement of each operation. These changes will apply as of the first TLTRO III operation to be allotted on 19 September 2019 and will be implemented in an amendment to the Decision of the ECB of 22 July 2019 on a third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (ECB/2019/21). For media queries, please contact Stefan Ruhkamp, tel.: +49 69 1344 5057. Notes: The ECB announced TLTRO III on 7 March 2019 and details on 6 June 2019.

The Governing Council had previously decided, in January 2017, that purchases of assets with yields below the deposit facility rate could take place under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP). Today’s decision extends this possibility to the private sector parts of the APP, namely the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3), the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP) and the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). This extension takes place with immediate effect and will facilitate the continued smooth implementation of the APP and reflects changes in market interest rates relative to the deposit facility rate. For media queries, please contact Eva Taylor, tel.: +49 69 1344 7162. Notes: The Governing Council decided on adjustments to the parameters of the APP on 8 December 2016.

(4) The modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) will be changed to preserve favourable bank lending conditions, ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy and further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy. The interest rate in each operation will now be set at the level of the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations over the life of the respective TLTRO. For banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied in TLTRO III operations will be lower, and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation. The maturity of the operations will be extended from two to three years. (5) In order to support the bank-based transmission of monetary policy, a two-tier system for reserve remuneration will be introduced, in which part of banks’ holdings of excess liquidity will be exempt from the negative deposit facility rate. Separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the Governing Council will be published this afternoon at 15:30 CET.

The Governing Council also underlined the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time, as inflation rates, both realised and projected, have been persistently below levels that are in line with its aim. Accordingly, if the medium-term inflation outlook continues to fall short of its aim, the Governing Council is determined to act, in line with its commitment to symmetry in the inflation aim. It therefore stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner. In this context, the Governing Council has tasked the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options, including ways to reinforce its forward guidance on policy rates, mitigating measures, such as the design of a tiered system for reserve remuneration, and options for the size and composition of potential new net asset purchases. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

"64","ECB announces details of new targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III)","ECB announces details of new targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) 6 June 2019 Operations aim to preserve favourable bank lending conditions and to support the accommodative stance of monetary policy TLTRO III interest rate will be set at 10 basis points above the average MRO rate over the life of each operation For counterparties exceeding their lending benchmark a lower interest rate will apply, which can be as low as the average deposit facility rate plus 10 basis points The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided on key parameters of the new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III), including the interest rates that will be charged. The quarterly operations, first announced in March, will help preserve favourable bank lending conditions and support the accommodative stance of monetary policy. They will start in September 2019 and end in March 2021, and have a maturity of two years each. The interest rate for each operation will be set at a level of 10 basis points above the average rate applied to the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations (MROs) over the life of the respective TLTRO. For counterparties whose eligible net lending between the end of March 2019 and the end of March 2021 exceeds their benchmark net lending, the rate applied to TLTRO III operations will be lower, and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the respective operation plus 10 basis points. Counterparties will receive the maximum rate reduction if they exceed their benchmark stock of eligible loans by 2.5% as at 31 March 2021. Below this limit, the size of the decrease in the interest rate will be graduated linearly depending on the percentage by which a counterparty exceeds its benchmark stock of eligible loans. For counterparties that exhibited positive eligible net lending in the 12-month period to 31 March 2019, the benchmark net lending is set at zero. For counterparties that exhibited negative eligible net lending in the 12-month period to 31 March 2019, the benchmark net lending is equal to the eligible net lending in that period. The interest rate applied to TLTRO III operations will be communicated to participants in September 2021. The first series of TLTROs was announced in June 2014 and the second series in March 2016. They are targeted operations because the amount that banks can borrow, as well as the borrowing rate, are linked to their loans to non-financial corporations and households (excluding loans for house purchase). Counterparties are entitled to borrow up to a total of 30% of the stock of eligible loans as at 28 February 2019. The amount counterparties can borrow under TLTRO III is reduced by any amount that they previously borrowed under TLTRO II that is still outstanding. In addition, the amount that counterparties can borrow in each of the seven operations will be limited to, at most, 10% of their stock of eligible loans as at 28 February 2019. TLTRO III operations cannot be repaid before maturity. Further technical details of the TLTRO III operations will be announced in due course. For media queries, please contact Stefan Ruhkamp, tel.: +49 69 1344 5057. Notes: As in the first two series of TLTROs, counterparties can participate in TLTRO III individually or, subject to certain conditions, on a group basis. In the latter case, the calculation of the TLTRO III group’s benchmark and borrowing allowances will be based on aggregated loan data for the TLTRO III group. As in the first two series of TLTROs, eligible loans are defined as those to euro area non-financial corporations and households excluding loans to households for house purchase. The ECB announced TLTRO III on 7 March 2019. Further information on TLTRO I and TLTRO II can be found on the ECB’s website.

"65","Monetary policy decisions","Monetary policy decisions 6 June 2019 At today’s meeting, which was held in Vilnius, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) took the following monetary policy decisions: (1) The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council now expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. (2) The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. (3) Regarding the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III), the Governing Council decided that the interest rate in each operation will be set at a level that is 10 basis points above the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations over the life of the respective TLTRO. For banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied in TLTRO III will be lower and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation plus 10 basis points. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

The new guidelines (Guidelines ECB/2019/11, ECB/2019/12 and ECB/2019/13) amend (i) the Guideline on the implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework (ECB/2014/60), (ii) the Guideline on the valuation haircuts applied in the implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework (ECB/2015/35), and (iii) the Guideline on additional temporary measures relating to Eurosystem refinancing operations and eligibility of collateral (ECB/2014/31). Among the amendments to the monetary policy implementation framework is the further harmonisation of the definition of agencies as issuers or guarantors of debt instruments. In particular, the criteria used for recognised agencies in the collateral framework and agencies eligible for the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) are being aligned. The Eurosystem is also incorporating the transparency requirements of the EU Securitisation Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 2017/2402) into its collateral framework. This decision was previously announced on 22 March 2019. In addition, the Eurosystem is phasing out the use of rating tools from its general framework for monetary policy operations owing to cost-benefit considerations. Accepted rating tools may continue to be used until further notice only in the national central banks’ (NCBs) additional credit claims frameworks. The conditions applicable will be communicated by the NCBs to the currently accepted rating tools. Applications to become rating tools will no longer be considered. Furthermore, the ECB is providing clarification on the treatment of credit claims in its collateral framework. In this context, the possibility of a theoretical valuation of credit claims is being removed from the general framework. The ECB is also amending the criteria for own-use of covered bonds. From 1 February 2020, covered bonds must have an external credit assessment institution (ECAI) rating to be eligible for own-use. Guidelines ECB/2019/11, ECB/2019/12 and ECB/2019/13 are available on the ECB’s website. Versions of the guidelines in 23 official EU languages are expected to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.

"68","Transparency requirements of EU Securitisation Regulation to be incorporated into Eurosystem collateral framework","Transparency requirements of EU Securitisation Regulation to be incorporated into Eurosystem collateral framework 22 March 2019 Eligibility requirements for loan-level data reporting in collateral framework to be adjusted to reflect EU Securitisation Regulation’s disclosure requirements Eligibility criteria for asset-backed securities to change at a future date, dependent on fulfilment of certain conditions Phasing-in of new loan-level data requirements will be gradual and will facilitate continued eligibility of transactions fulfilling current reporting standards The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided that the loan-level data reporting requirements of the Eurosystem collateral framework will converge towards the disclosure requirements and registration process for securitisation repositories specified in the Securitisation Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 2017/2402). The ECB has taken this decision with a view to promoting efficiency and standardisation in the securitisation market. The Securitisation Regulation sets out the rules for all securitisation transactions and creates a framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation. It will enhance harmonisation and transparency in the securitisation market and strengthen the efforts, initiated in 2013 with the establishment of the ECB’s loan-level data initiative, to support a higher degree of transparency in the asset-backed securities (ABS) market. The disclosure requirements of the Securitisation Regulation will be reflected in the eligibility requirements for the acceptance of ABSs as collateral in the Eurosystem’s liquidity-providing operations. In addition, the ECB will phase out its designation process for loan-level data repositories and will rely instead on the registration of securitisation repositories by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) under the Securitisation Regulation. The Securitisation Regulation became applicable on 1 January 2019. ABSs issued after that date and older ABSs seeking to obtain the simple, transparent and standardised (STS) label, as defined in Chapter 4 of the Regulation, will be subject to its provisions. However, the change in the Eurosystem’s loan-level data reporting requirements to reflect the Securitisation Regulation’s disclosure requirements and registration process for securitisation repositories is dependent on two conditions being met. First, the underlying exposure templates specified in the implementation technical standards adopted by the European Commission under Article 7(4) of the Securitisation Regulation must have entered into force. Second, at least one securitisation repository must have been registered by ESMA. The change in the Eurosystem’s transparency requirements will come into effect after a transitional period of three months from the date on which these two conditions are fulfilled. For ABSs issued prior to 1 January 2019 which are not subject to the Regulation, the Eurosytem’s current loan-level data reporting requirements will be maintained for a grandfathering period of three years after the date on which the change in the ECB’s transparency requirements becomes effective. After that period, it is envisaged that the disclosure requirements of the Securitisation Regulation will apply in full to these ABSs.

(3) A new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) will be launched, starting in September 2019 and ending in March 2021, each with a maturity of two years. These new operations will help to preserve favourable bank lending conditions and the smooth transmission of monetary policy. Under TLTRO-III, counterparties will be entitled to borrow up to 30% of the stock of eligible loans as at 28 February 2019 at a rate indexed to the interest rate on the main refinancing operations over the life of each operation. Like the outstanding TLTRO programme, TLTRO-III will feature built-in incentives for credit conditions to remain favourable. Further details on the precise terms of TLTRO-III will be communicated in due course. (4) The Eurosystem’s lending operations will continue to be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in March 2021.

The ECB will receive pound sterling from the Bank of England in exchange for euro. The activation marks a prudent and precautionary step by the Bank of England to provide additional flexibility in its provision of liquidity insurance, supporting the functioning of markets that serve households and businesses. The swap line between the ECB and the Bank of England is part of a network of standing arrangements with four other central banks, including the Bank of Canada, the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank. These standing swap lines were agreed in October 2013 and replaced a set of temporary arrangements. Liquidity providing arrangements contribute to global financial stability. As part of the same agreement, the Eurosystem would stand ready to lend pound sterling to euro area banks, if the need arises. The ECB will continue to work closely with the Bank of England to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review.

The Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) is an ECB staff-level exercise whose key objective is to gather regular, comprehensive, structured and systematic information on market participants’ expectations of the future evolution of key policy parameters. The SMA is to be run eight times a year, aligned with the schedule of the monetary policy meetings of the Governing Council. The first round of the survey will be conducted ahead of the Governing Council meeting of April 2019. The ECB will publish the results after the pilot phase. During this phase ECB staff will perform quality checks and implement internal quality improvements to the questionnaire, thereby ensuring the meaningfulness of the results. The pilot phase is expected to consist of seven rounds. The ECB will select respondents from the list of banks and financial institutions participating in the ECB’s Market Contact Groups. The selection criteria will include market relevance, geographical representativeness, commitment to participating regularly in subsequent rounds of the survey, and whether the institution is actively involved in the areas of activity covered by the survey. The panel composition and the survey questionnaire will be published in due course and will be reviewed at the end of the pilot phase.

"73","ECB decides on technical parameters for the reinvestment of its asset purchase programme","ECB decides on technical parameters for the reinvestment of its asset purchase programme 13 December 2018 ECB details technical parameters for APP reinvestments ECB capital key, as amended over time, to continue guiding public sector purchase programme during reinvestment The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided on the technical parameters for the reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under its asset purchase programme (APP) after net asset purchases cease at the end of December 2018. The Governing Council will aim to maintain the size of its cumulative net purchases under each constituent programme of the APP, i.e. the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP), the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3) and the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP), at their respective levels as at the end of December 2018. Limited temporary deviations in the overall size and composition of the APP may occur during the reinvestment for operational reasons. For the PSPP, the allocation across eligible jurisdictions will continue to be guided, on a stock basis, by the respective national central banks’ subscription to the ECB capital key, as amended over time. As a rule, therefore, redemptions will be reinvested in the jurisdiction in which principal repayments are made, but the portfolio allocation across jurisdictions will continue to be adjusted with a view to bringing the share of the PSPP portfolio into closer alignment with the respective national central banks’ subscription to the ECB capital key. Any adjustment to the portfolio allocation across jurisdictions will be gradual and will be calibrated as appropriate to safeguard orderly market conditions. During the reinvestment phase the Eurosystem will continue to adhere to the principle of market neutrality via smooth and flexible implementation. To this end, the reinvestment of principal redemptions will be distributed over the year to allow for a regular and balanced market presence. Within the PSPP, purchases of securities with a yield to maturity below the interest rate on the ECB’s deposit facility will continue to be undertaken to the extent necessary. For the private sector programmes, market capitalisation will continue to be the guiding principle for reinvestment purchases. Purchases of securities in primary markets will continue to be permitted as necessary. With regard to the CBPP3, the Governing Council also clarified that all CBPP3-eligible covered bonds with a conditional pass-through structure will be excluded from purchase as of 1 January 2019. For media queries, please contact Eva Taylor, tel.: +49 69 1344 7162.

"79","Monetary policy decisions","Monetary policy decisions 14 June 2018 At today’s meeting, which was held in Riga, the Governing Council of the ECB undertook a careful review of the progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, also taking into account the latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, measures of price and wage pressures, and uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook. Based on this review the Governing Council made the following decisions: First, as regards non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council will continue to make net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018. The Governing Council anticipates that, after September 2018, subject to incoming data confirming the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation outlook, the monthly pace of the net asset purchases will be reduced to €15 billion until the end of December 2018 and that net purchases will then end. Second, the Governing Council intends to maintain its policy of reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Third, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with the current expectations of a sustained adjustment path. Today’s monetary policy decisions maintain the current ample degree of monetary accommodation that will ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.

"84","Additional information on asset purchase programme","Additional information on asset purchase programme 26 October 2017 ECB provides additional data on redemptions as well as information about reinvestments and role of private sector purchase programmes Additional information supports continued smooth implementation of asset purchases The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to publish from now on, with a monthly frequency, the expected monthly redemption amounts for the asset purchase programme (APP) over a rolling 12-month horizon. It has also decided to provide additional details on the implementation of the programme. This reflects the ECB’s commitment to increase transparency further. The redemption dataset will include the estimated cumulative monthly redemptions for each of the four individual components of the APP, i.e. the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP), the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3), the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP), for a rolling 12-month period. These will be accompanied by the historical redemption figures since the start of the APP. The first monthly release will be published on 6 November 2017. The decision to start publishing these data reflects their increasing relevance, given the higher redemption amounts that will be seen in 2018. Principal redemptions on securities purchased under the PSPP are reinvested by the Eurosystem in a flexible and timely manner in the month they fall due, on a best effort basis, or in the subsequent two months, if warranted by market liquidity conditions. The published monthly net purchase volumes per jurisdiction may therefore fluctuate owing to the timing of these reinvestments. During the period of net asset purchases, PSPP principal redemptions will be reinvested in the jurisdiction in which the maturing bond was issued. The Eurosystem anticipates that the purchase volumes under the three private sector purchase programmes (the ABSPP, the CBPP3 and the CSPP) will remain sizeable.

The use of CNY as a global international currency has increased in recent years. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) determined the renminbi to be a freely usable currency in its five-yearly review of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) Currency Basket in 2015. Since October 2016, the IMF has approved its inclusion in the SDR basket as the fifth currency, alongside the US dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. The ECB’s investment also reflects the importance of China as one of the euro area’s largest trading partners. The investment in CNY was made by changing the current composition of the ECB’s foreign reserves. The ECB sold a small portion of its US dollar holdings, which remain the largest portfolio, leaving the overall size of the ECB’s foreign reserves unchanged. The ECB’s foreign reserves now comprise US dollars, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, gold and SDRs. For media queries, please contact Lena-Sophie Demuth, tel.: +49 69 1344 5423.

"93","Monetary policy decisions","Monetary policy decisions 19 January 2017 At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that it will continue to make purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of €80 billion until the end of March 2017 and that, from April 2017, the net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of €60 billion until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

This had been envisaged and announced when the programme was first launched.[1] As of 1 April 2017, Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique, Deutsche Bundesbank, Banco de España, Banque de France, Banca d’Italia and De Nederlandsche Bank will act as asset managers executing purchases on behalf of the Eurosystem. The ABSPP, launched in late 2014, is one of the ECB’s programmes to enhance the transmission of monetary policy and facilitate credit provision to the real economy. Under the programme, the Eurosystem buys simple and transparent ABSs. As of 1 April 2017, the allocation of ABS markets to Eurosystem asset managers will be as follows: ABSPP asset manager Jurisdictions covered (split according to location of assets as underlying collateral for the ABS)* Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique Belgium Deutsche Bundesbank Germany Banco de España Spain Banque de France Finland, France, Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal Banca d’Italia Italy De Nederlandsche Bank The Netherlands * Other markets will only be explicitly allocated in case of eligible issuance.

In addition to the extension of the programme, the following parameters will be adjusted on 2 January 2017: The maturity range of the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) will be broadened by decreasing the minimum remaining maturity for eligible securities from two years to one year. Purchases of securities under the APP with a yield to maturity below the interest rate on the ECB’s deposit facility will be permitted to the extent necessary. The implementation details will be worked out by the relevant committees. For media queries, please contact William Lelieveldt, tel.: +49 69 1344 7316.

"96","Eurosystem introduces cash collateral for PSPP securities lending facilities","Eurosystem introduces cash collateral for PSPP securities lending facilities 8 December 2016 New possibility to use cash as collateral Pricing will be linked to the deposit facility rate Changes aim to enhance effectiveness of PSPP securities lending Maximum overall limit of €50 billion for the Eurosystem Today, the Governing Council decided that Eurosystem central banks will have the possibility to also accept cash as collateral in their PSPP securities lending (SL) facilities without having to reinvest it in a cash-neutral manner. The following Eurosystem members will make securities lending available also against cash collateral by 15 December 2016: the ECB, Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique, Deutsche Bundesbank, Central Bank of Ireland, Banco de España, Banque de France, and De Nederlandsche Bank. The overall limit for securities lending against cash collateral is set at €50 billion for the Eurosystem. To avoid unduly curtailing normal repo market activity, the cash collateral option will be offered at a rate equal to the lower of the rate of the deposit facility minus 30 basis points (i.e. currently -70 basis points) and the prevailing market repo rate. The introduction of cash as collateral in the context of PSPP securities lending is intended to enhance the effectiveness of the SL framework, thereby supporting the smooth implementation of the PSPP as well as the euro area repo market liquidity and functioning. This technical amendment does not represent any change in the monetary policy stance of the Eurosystem. It will be reviewed in light of operational needs and the level of excess liquidity.

The Governing Council of the ECB has decided on a number of measures to improve the overall consistency of the framework. The Governing Council decided in particular, with effect from 1 January 2017, to: 1. Update the haircuts for marketable and non-marketable assets; 2. Introduce graduated haircuts for eligible asset-backed securities (ABS) based on their Weighted Average Life (WAL) as calculated from expected cash flows Moreover, the Governing Council decided to: 3. Introduce graduated haircuts depending on remaining maturity also for floating-rate assets, which are currently assigned a flat haircut irrespective of their maturities 4. Adjust the risk control measures for retained covered bonds with extendible maturities (e.g. soft bullet and conditional pass-through covered bonds) to take into account the additional risk which results from the use of such securities by the issuer itself and to ensure a level playing field between securities with comparable risks As regards the first two measures, the new haircut schedules are defined in the new Guidelines ECB/2016/32 and ECB/2016/33 (amending Guideline ECB/2015/35 and Guideline ECB/2014/31, relating to the general and the temporary collateral framework, respectively). These guidelines have become available on the ECB’s website. As regards the last two measures, they will become applicable at a date to be announced in the second half of 2017.

"99","ECB amends Guidelines relating to the Eurosystem’s monetary policy implementation","ECB amends Guidelines relating to the Eurosystem’s monetary policy implementation 3 November 2016 Implementation of previously announced changes in the eligibility of uncovered bank bonds Refinement of the rules on acceptable coupon structures Clarification regarding designated repositories for ABS loan-level data The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published three new guidelines (Guidelines ECB/2016/31, ECB/2016/32 and ECB/2016/33). These guidelines provide amendments to (i) the General Documentation Guideline on the implementation of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy (ECB/2014/60), (ii) the Guideline on Valuation Haircuts (ECB/2015/35) and (iii) the Guideline on Additional Temporary Measures relating to Eurosystem refinancing operations and eligibility of collateral (ECB/2014/31). The new Guidelines introduce changes to the monetary policy implementation framework, including: First, the Eurosystem is introducing some changes to the collateral eligibility criteria and risk control measures with respect to senior unsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions or investment firms. The ECB announced these changes in a press release on 5 October 2016. Second, the Eurosystem is amending the rules on acceptable coupon structures to make certain assets with negative cash flows eligible. According to the new requirements, negative cash flows are allowed for coupon payments of marketable assets and for non‑marketable debt instruments backed by eligible credit claims (DECCs) so as to reflect the current context of low/negative market rates. The valuation methodology ensures that collateral prices are lowered by expected negative cash flows and risk-mitigating measures are in place to make sure counterparties are fully liable for negative cash flows that may materialise when such assets are mobilised as collateral. Third, in the context of asset-backed securities (ABS) loan-level data, the Eurosystem is further clarifying the criteria for a loan-level data repository to become “designated by the Eurosystem” and the application process for designation. Only ABS for which loan-level data submissions have been made to “designated” repositories may be considered for compliance with the Eurosystem’s ABS loan-level requirements. Fourth, as a further specification to the collateral eligibility criteria relating to credit claims, as of 1 January 2018 the Eurosystem is explicitly requiring that only those credit claims be mobilised as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations in which the set-off risk has been excluded or significantly mitigated. Set-off rights arise in situations where a debtor has a legal right to set off or net its obligations towards a creditor by the amount of outstanding claims the debtor has against the creditor. A set-off risk is the risk of loss for the ESCB which arises when an ESCB central bank enforces a credit claim presented as collateral by a defaulting counterparty whereby the credit claim mobilised as collateral would have lost part of its value as a result of set-off. Fifth, the Eurosystem is updating the haircut schedules for assets used as collateral in monetary policy operations, as detailed in a dedicated press release. These adjustments aim to improve the general consistency of the framework while having an overall minimal effect on the amount of collateral available. Sixth, the Eurosystem is introducing minimum disclosure requirements for covered bond ratings issued by credit rating agencies accepted in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework (ECAF). According to these requirements, as of 1 July 2017, credit rating agencies will be required to publish new issue reports and quarterly surveillance reports for rated covered bond programmes in order to meet the high credit standards of the ECAF. If these requirements are not met, the credit rating may not be used to establish the credit quality requirements for marketable assets. In addition to ensuring that credit ratings are up to date, these disclosure requirements aim to enhance the transparency of covered bond ratings accepted by the Eurosystem. Seventh, the Eurosystem is clarifying the acceptance criteria for credit rating agencies as External Credit Assessment Institutions in the ECAF. For example, further clarity is provided on the Eurosystem’s minimum coverage requirements as regards ratings of eligible issuers and assets, as well as additional details on how coverage is calculated. These changes fully reflect the corresponding announcement in January 2016 under “Other decisions” of the Governing Council. Guidelines ECB/2016/31, ECB/2016/32 and ECB/2016/33 have been published on the ECB’s website for information purposes. The Guidelines in 23 official EU languages are expected to be published in December 2016 in the Official Journal of the European Union.

"101","Changes to collateral eligibility criteria and risk control measures for unsecured bank bonds","Changes to collateral eligibility criteria and risk control measures for unsecured bank bonds 5 October 2016 ECB will amend eligibility criteria and risk control measures applicable to senior unsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions or investment firms within its collateral framework, with effect from 1 January 2017 Changes ensure eligibility of senior unsecured debt instruments of such issuers subject to statutory subordination Revisions are in response to the implementation of the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive in EU Member States Framework to be revisited during the course of 2017, and final collateral eligibility criteria to also depend on further progress towards a common EU approach to the bank creditor hierarchy The European Central Bank (ECB) has today decided on changes to the collateral eligibility criteria and risk control measures applicable to senior unsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions or investment firms or their closely linked entities. These instruments are known as unsecured bank bonds (UBBs). The ECB has decided to maintain the eligibility of UBBs for the time being, including the eligibility of statutorily subordinated UBBs that are not also contractually subordinated, which under the current rules would have become ineligible as at 1 January 2017. Eligibility will also be subject to additional risk control measures. The ECB has decided to reduce, as of 1 January 2017, the usage limit for uncovered bank bonds from 5% to 2.5%. This limit shall not apply where (a) the value of such assets does not exceed €50 million after any applicable haircut or (b) such assets are guaranteed by a public sector entity which has the right to levy taxes, by way of a guarantee that complies with the provisions of Article 114 of the ECB Guideline on the implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework (known as the General Documentation Guideline). The need to adjust the collateral eligibility criteria for UBBs has been triggered by the implementation of the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) in EU Member States and the forthcoming minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), as well as by the need for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) to adhere to the new total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) framework. This has prompted EU Member States to adopt various legislative approaches to facilitate the ability of banks to issue UBBs with different insolvency rankings. The ECB reaffirms its support in reaching agreement on a common EU approach to the creditor hierarchy in bank insolvency and resolution, and notes that work is ongoing in this respect. The ECB will review this decision during the course of 2017, and the collateral eligibility framework eventually applicable to UBBs will also reflect progress made within that period towards a common EU approach.

On 8 October 2013 the ECB and the PBC established a three-year bilateral currency swap arrangement with a maximum size of 350 billion in Chinese renminbi and 45 billion in euro. From a Eurosystem perspective, the arrangement serves as a backstop facility to address potential sudden and temporary disruptions in the renminbi market due to liquidity shortages in euro area banks. Liquidity providing arrangements contribute to global financial stability. The arrangement with the PBC is a recognition of the rapidly growing bilateral trade and investment between the euro area and China. As part of the ECB’s plan to regularly test its operational capabilities, the ECB and the PBC conducted two tests in April 2015 and November 2015 that provided symbolic amounts of euro and renminbi liquidity respectively. The tests were successful and demonstrated the ECB’s and the PBC’s operational readiness to activate the swap if needed on the basis of bilaterally agreed operational procedures.

"106","ECB reinstates waiver affecting the eligibility of Greek bonds used as collateral in Eurosystem monetary policy operations","ECB reinstates waiver affecting the eligibility of Greek bonds used as collateral in Eurosystem monetary policy operations 22 June 2016 ECB’s Governing Council reinstates waiver of minimum credit rating requirements for marketable instruments issued or guaranteed by the Hellenic Republic, subject to special haircuts Waiver will enter into force on the next MRO settlement date (29 June 2016) Governing Council acknowledges the commitment of the Greek government to implementing current ESM programme and expects continued compliance with its conditionality Possible purchases of Greek bonds under the PSPP will be examined at a later stage The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to reinstate the waiver affecting the eligibility of marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Hellenic Republic. The decision suspends the application of the minimum credit rating threshold in the collateral eligibility requirements for these instruments. Provided that they fulfil all other eligibility criteria, they may be used as collateral in Eurosystem monetary policy operations. The suspension enters into force with the relevant legal act on the next main refinancing operation (MRO) settlement date, 29 June 2016, and will be maintained until further notice. It applies to all outstanding and new marketable debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the Hellenic Republic. The haircuts applied to these assets will be specified in the legal act. The Governing Council has taken into consideration the approval of the first disbursement of the second tranche of the current European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme for Greece by the ESM’s Board of Directors, following the positive assessment by the European Commission, in liaison with the ECB, of a policy package which resulted in the completion of the first review of the programme. The Governing Council also acknowledges the commitment of the Greek government to implementing the ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme and, therefore, expects continued compliance with its conditionality. The Governing Council will examine possible purchases of Greek government bonds under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) at a later stage, taking into account the progress made in the analysis and reinforcement of Greece’s debt sustainability, as well as other risk management considerations.

"107","ECB announces remaining details of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP)","ECB announces remaining details of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) 2 June 2016 Purchases will start on 8 June 2016. Remaining details are provided on issuer eligibility. Eligible issuers which are public undertakings will be allocated either to the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) or to the CSPP. A list of bonds purchased will be published weekly for the purpose of securities lending. Today the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided that purchases under its corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) will start on 8 June 2016. The Governing Council also took decisions on the remaining details of the CSPP. The CSPP is a new programme added to the existing elements of the asset purchase programme that will strengthen the pass-through of asset purchases to the real economy. The Governing Council further clarified what constitutes an eligible issuer in line with its previous decision to purchase debt instruments issued by non-bank corporations. Issuers supervised under the Single Supervisory Mechanism, as well as their subsidiaries, will not be eligible for purchases under the CSPP. Issuers with a parent company that is subject to banking supervision outside the euro area are also excluded. Finally, issuers which are comparable to banks in terms of their activities, e.g. the provision of one or more investment services to third parties and/or the performance of one or more investment activities on a professional basis according to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), are not eligible. The Governing Council also conducted a review of all public undertakings that comply with the eligibility criteria of the PSPP and the CSPP and decided that such undertakings will henceforth only be eligible for purchases under either the CSPP or the PSPP. In this context, certain agency issuers which were previously eligible under the PSPP will instead become eligible for the CSPP. Bonds held under the CSPP will be made available for lending as of 18 July 2016. A list of the International Securities Identification Numbers (ISINs) of the bonds held by the purchasing NCBs under the CSPP will be published and updated on a weekly basis. Additional details are outlined in the question and answer documents published on the ECB’s website: On the CSPP: http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/cspp-qa.en.html On the PSPP: http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/pspp-qa.en.html The legal act on the CSPP will be published on 3 June 2016.

"110","ECB announces details of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP)","ECB announces details of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) 21 April 2016 The CSPP aims to further strengthen the pass-through of the Eurosystem’s asset purchases to the financing conditions of the real economy. Purchases will start in June 2016. The CSPP will be carried out by six national central banks acting on behalf of the Eurosystem, coordinated by the ECB. In combination with other non-standard measures, the programme will provide further monetary policy accommodation and help inflation rates return to levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. Further to its decision of 10 March 2016 to add a corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) to the asset purchase programme (APP), the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided on the main technical parameters of the programme. The Eurosystem’s collateral framework – the rules that lay down which assets are acceptable as collateral for monetary policy credit operations – will be the basis for determining the eligibility of corporate sector securities to be purchased under the CSPP. The following technical parameters will apply: - The programme will start in June 2016. - Outright purchases of investment-grade euro-denominated bonds issued by non-bank corporations established in the euro area will be carried out by six Eurosystem national central banks (NCBs): Nationale Bank van België / Banque Nationale de Belgique, Deutsche Bundesbank, Banco de España, Banque de France, Banca d’Italia, and Suomen Pankki/Finlands Bank. Each NCB will be responsible for purchases from issuers in a particular part of the euro area. The ECB will coordinate the purchases. - The purchases will be conducted in the primary and secondary markets, but no primary market purchases will involve debt instruments issued by entities that qualify as public undertakings. - Debt instruments will be eligible for purchase, provided they fulfil all the following criteria: they are eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, based on the requirements defined in the Guideline on the implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework (ECB/2014/60); they are denominated in euro; they have a minimum first-best credit assessment of at least credit quality step 3 (rating of BBB- or equivalent) obtained from an external credit assessment institution according to Guideline ECB/2014/60; they have a minimum remaining maturity of six months and a maximum remaining maturity of 30 years at the time of purchase; the issuer is a corporation established in the euro area, defined as the location of incorporation of the issuer. Corporate debt instruments issued by corporations incorporated in the euro area whose ultimate parent is not based in the euro area are also eligible for purchase under the CSPP, provided they fulfil all the other eligibility criteria; the issuer of the debt instrument: is not a credit institution, does not have any parent undertaking (as defined in Article 4(15) of the Capital Requirements Regulation) which is a credit institution (as defined in Article 2 (14) of Guideline ECB/2014/60), is not an asset management vehicle (as defined in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation) or a national asset management and divestment fund established to support financial sector restructuring and/or resolution. - Purchases under the CSPP will be conducted with counterparties that are eligible for the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations or counterparties that are used by the Eurosystem for the investment of its euro-denominated portfolios. - The Eurosystem will apply an issue share limit of 70% per international securities identification number (ISIN) on the basis of the outstanding amount. However, in specific cases a lower issue share limit will apply, e.g. for securities issued by public undertakings, which will be dealt with in a manner consistent with their treatment under the PSPP. - A benchmark will be defined at issuer group level. The benchmark will be neutral in the sense that it will reflect proportionally all outstanding issues qualifying for the benchmark. This also implies that market capitalisation provides a weighting for each of the jurisdictions of issuance within the benchmark. Issuer group limits will be based on the benchmark to ensure a diverse portfolio, while at the same time they will offer sufficient leeway to build up the portfolio. - The Eurosystem will conduct appropriate credit risk and due diligence procedures on the purchasable universe on an ongoing basis. - The volume of CSPP holdings will be published on a weekly and monthly basis. A breakdown of primary and secondary market purchases will also be published every month. - The CSPP holdings will be made available for securities lending by the relevant NCBs.

"112","ECB adds corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) to the asset purchase programme (APP) and announces changes to APP","ECB adds corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) to the asset purchase programme (APP) and announces changes to APP 10 March 2016 Combined monthly purchases under the APP are to increase as of 1 April 2016 to €80 billion from €60 billion. Investment-grade euro-denominated bonds issued by non-bank corporations established in the euro area will be included in the list of assets eligible for regular purchases under a new corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). The CSPP will be added to the APP and will be included in the combined monthly purchases. The CSPP will further strengthen the pass-through of the Eurosystem’s asset purchases to the financing conditions of the real economy. Purchases are to start towards the end of the second quarter of 2016. The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to establish a new programme to purchase investment-grade euro-denominated bonds issued by non-bank corporations established in the euro area with the aim of further strengthening the pass-through of the Eurosystem’s asset purchases to the financing conditions of the real economy. As a result, and in conjunction with the other non-standard measures in place, the CSPP will provide further monetary policy accommodation and contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. Eligibility under the Eurosystem’s collateral framework – the rules that lay out which assets are acceptable as collateral for monetary policy credit operations – will be a necessary condition for determining the eligibility of assets to be purchased under the CSPP, subject to further criteria. Securities issued by credit institutions and by entities with a parent company which belongs to a banking group will not be eligible. CSPP purchases will begin towards the end of the second quarter of 2016. Further technical details on the CSPP will be announced in due course. The Governing Council also decided to adjust the parameters of the public sector purchase programme (PSPP). The issuer and issue share limits for securities issued by eligible international organisations and multilateral development banks will be increased to 50%. In addition, as of April 2016 the share of such securities purchased under the PSPP will be reduced from 12% to 10% on a monthly basis. To maintain the 20% risk-sharing regime, the ECB’s share of monthly PSPP purchases will be increased from 8% to 10%. For media queries, please contact Stefan Ruhkamp, tel.: +49 69 1344 5057.

"113","ECB announces new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO II)","ECB announces new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO II) 10 March 2016 Four new targeted longer-term refinancing operations to reinforce the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance and to foster new lending. The new operations will be conducted from June 2016 to March 2017 at a quarterly frequency. All the new operations will have a four-year maturity, with the possibility of repayment after two years. Counterparties exceeding the lending benchmark will borrow at a rate that can be as low as the rate on the deposit facility at the time of allotment. The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided today to launch a new series of four targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO II). The new operations will offer attractive long-term funding conditions to banks to further ease private sector credit conditions and to stimulate credit creation. TLTRO II is intended to reinforce the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance and to strengthen the transmission of monetary policy by further incentivising bank lending to the real economy. In conjunction with the other non-standard measures in place, TLTRO II will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Counterparties [1] will be able to borrow in the operations a total amount of up to 30% of a specific eligible part of their loans [2] as at 31 January 2016, less any amount which was previously borrowed and is still outstanding under the first two TLTRO operations conducted in 2014. The four TLTRO II operations will be conducted in June, September and December 2016 and in March 2017. All TLTRO II operations will have a maturity of four years from their settlement date. Counterparties will be able to repay the amounts borrowed under TLTRO II at a quarterly frequency starting two years from the settlement of each operation. Counterparties will not be subject to mandatory early repayments. The interest rate applied to TLTRO II will be fixed for each operation at the rate applied in the main refinancing operations (MROs) prevailing at the time of allotment. In addition, counterparties whose eligible net lending in the period between 1 February 2016 and 31 January 2018 exceeds their benchmark will be charged a lower rate for the entire term of the operation. This lower rate will be linked to the interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing at the time of the allotment of each operation. Counterparties will receive the maximum rate reduction equal to the difference between the MRO rate and the rate on the deposit facility applicable at the time of take-up if they exceed their benchmark stock of eligible loans by 2.5% in total as at 31 January 2018. Up to this limit, the size of the decrease in the interest rate will be graduated linearly depending on the percentage by which a counterparty exceeds its benchmark stock of eligible loans. For counterparties that exhibited positive eligible net lending in the 12-month period to 31 January 2016, the benchmark net lending is set at zero. For counterparties that exhibited negative eligible net lending in the 12-month period to 31 January 2016, the benchmark net lending is equal to the eligible net lending in that period. The dedicated reporting scheme of the first series of TLTROs will be retained for TLTRO II, with only two report submissions required, i.e. one to document the borrowing allowance and the benchmark, and one to check the lending performance against the benchmark in two years’ time. In addition, the Governing Council decided to introduce an additional voluntary repayment possibility for all currently outstanding TLTROs in June 2016, coinciding with the settlement of the first TLTRO II operation. This will allow counterparties to roll over amounts borrowed under the current TLTROs into TLTRO II. The remaining two operations of the current TLTRO programme will be implemented in March 2016 and June 2016, as originally scheduled. Further technical details of the TLTRO II operations will be announced in due course. For media queries, please contact Stefan Ruhkamp, tel.: +49 69 1344 5057. [1]As in the first series of TLTROs, counterparties can participate in TLTRO II individually or, subject to certain conditions, on a group basis. In the latter case, the calculation of the TLTRO II group’s benchmark and borrowing allowances will be based on aggregated loan data for the TLTRO II group. [2]As in the first series of TLTROs, eligible loans are defined as those to euro area non-financial corporations and households excluding loans to households for house purchase.

ANFA is an agreement between the national central banks (NCBs) of the euro area and the ECB. It sets rules and limits for non-monetary policy holdings that are related to national tasks of the NCBs. The ECB publishes the Eurosystem’s aggregate net financial assets, and the NCBs will publish their respective net financial assets on an annual basis (at the time of publication of the annual financial accounts). At the end of 2015 the Eurosystem’s aggregate net financial assets stood at €490 billion. NFAs have grown at 5% per year on average since the introduction of euro banknotes in 2002. This is slower than the pace of banknotes in circulation, which grew by 9% per year on average over the same period. ANFA has been used to limit the capacity of NCBs to create liquidity in accordance with monetary policy objectives. Although ANFA was previously a confidential document, the ECB and the national central banks of the Eurosystem took the unanimous decision that publishing the text along with an explanatory document would better serve their commitment to greater transparency, in line with the ECB’s decision in 2014 to publish accounts of monetary policy meetings and its decision in 2015 to publish the calendars of its Executive Board members. The ECB also releases a document with questions and answers to explain the details and purpose of ANFA, accompanied by the agreement itself.

From a Eurosystem perspective, the arrangement serves as a backstop facility to address sudden and temporary disruptions in the renminbi market due to liquidity shortages in euro area banks. Liquidity providing arrangements contribute to global financial stability and the arrangement with the PBC is a recognition of the rapidly growing bilateral trade and investment between the euro area and China. In October 2013 the ECB and the PBC established a bilateral currency swap arrangement with a maximum size of 350 billion in Chinese renminbi and 45 billion in euro. As part of the ECB’s plan to regularly test its operational capabilities, the ECB and the PBC conducted two tests in April 2015 and November 2015 that provided symbolic amounts of euro and renminbi liquidity respectively. These tests also involved a limited number of Chinese and Eurosystem counterparties. The tests were successful and demonstrated the ECB’s and the PBC’s operational readiness to activate the swap if needed on the basis of bilaterally agreed operational procedures. The ECB regularly conducts tests of its instruments and operations in order to ensure its operational readiness. The scheduling of such tests is not linked to market conditions and should not be seen as signalling any intention of the central banks to request funds from each other to provide counterparties with liquidity in the respective currency.

"119","ECB publishes two Guidelines relating to changes in the General Documentation","ECB publishes two Guidelines relating to changes in the General Documentation 20 November 2015 Specific provisions relating to Eurosystem valuation haircuts moved from the General Documentation [1] to a new, separate Guideline; Rules refined for valuation haircuts applicable to own-used covered bonds; Non-marketable debt instruments backed by eligible credit claims (DECCs) now for cross-border use via standard CCBM procedure. The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published (i) a new Guideline (ECB/2015/34) amending the General Documentation Guideline on the implementation of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy and (ii) a new Guideline (ECB/2015/35) on the Eurosystem’s valuation haircuts. The new Guidelines introduce changes to the monetary policy implementation framework, including: First, the provisions on the Eurosystem’s valuation haircuts have been removed from the General Documentation and put into the new Guideline on the Eurosystem’s valuation haircuts. This will provide information on valuation haircuts for counterparties in a standalone legal instrument. Second, the new Guideline on valuation haircuts refines the provisions on additional haircuts applied to covered bonds that are own-used (i.e. submitted as collateral by the issuer of the covered bonds or an entity closely linked to the issuer). As a rule, the additional haircuts will be applied only to the share of the covered bond issue that is own-used and not to the entire issue. Third, “ non-marketable debt instruments backed by eligible credit claims”, an asset class introduced in the Eurosystem’s collateral framework on 2 November 2015, will be eligible for cross-border use through the Eurosystem’s standard correspondent central banking model (CCBM) procedure. Guidelines ECB/2015/34 and ECB/2015/35 are published on the ECB’s website for information purposes. The Guidelines in 23 official EU languages are expected to be published in January 2016 in the Official Journal of the European Union.

"120","Increase in PSPP issue share limit enlarges purchasable universe","Increase in PSPP issue share limit enlarges purchasable universe 9 November 2015 Eurosystem publishes amended legal act to reflect the decision of the Governing Council of 3 September 2015 to increase the PSPP issue share limit, making the higher issue limit effective Issue share limit set at 33% per bond except for some bonds containing a collective action clause (CAC) that differs from the euro area model CAC for which a case-by-case verification is envisaged The 33% issue share limit allows for a significant increase in the purchasable amount both for outstanding and for newly issued PSPP eligible securities The increase aims to facilitate the full and smooth implementation of the PSPP, while continuing to limit undue concentration that could undermine market liquidity and create a blocking minority in relation to collective action clauses The ECB today publishes the amended legal act on a secondary markets public sector asset purchase programme (ECB/2015/10) [1]. The amendment follows the Governing Council decision of 3 September 2015 to increase the PSPP issue share limit from 25% to 33% per international securities identification number (ISIN), subject to verification on a case-by-case basis that a holding of 33% per ISIN would not lead the Eurosystem central banks to reach blocking minority holdings in relation to collective action clauses. As of 10 November 2015, the PSPP issue share limit will be set at 33% per ISIN. This higher issue limit allows for a significant increase in the purchasable amount both for outstanding and for newly issued PSPP eligible securities. It facilitates the full and smooth implementation of the PSPP, while at the same time allowing the smooth operation of markets in eligible marketable debt securities and avoiding that the Eurosystem owns effective blocking minority holdings in relation to collective action clauses.

As of 27 October 2015, Banque de France (with an increased number of jurisdictions covered) and Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique will both act as Eurosystem asset managers executing purchases. In addition, the ECB has decided to extend the contracts of two of its external executing asset managers. The executing asset managers will continue to conduct eligible ABS purchase transactions on explicit instructions from, and on behalf of the Eurosystem. The Eurosystem will maintain its role in undertaking price checks and due diligence prior to approving transactions. The contracts with all executing asset managers contain provisions to mitigate any conflicts of interest, subject to checks by external auditors. The ABSPP, launched in late 2014, is one of the ECB’s programmes to enhance the transmission of monetary policy and facilitate credit provision to the real economy. Under the programme, the ECB and Eurosystem buy simple and transparent ABSs for at least two years. For media queries, please contact William Lelieveldt, tel.: +49 69 1344 7316.

"124","ECB publishes Guideline amending the General Documentation on monetary policy implementation","ECB publishes Guideline amending the General Documentation on monetary policy implementation 31 August 2015 Counterparty eligibility assessment to take into account information on capital, leverage and liquidity ratios New category of assets added as eligible collateral Today the European Central Bank (ECB) has published a new Guideline (ECB/2015/27) amending the General Documentation (GD) [1] on the implementation of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy. The new Guideline introduces some changes to the monetary policy implementation framework: First, the provisions on counterparty eligibility have been revised in light of recent legislative developments in the implementation of the Banking Union. In particular, the provisions now state that the Eurosystem may take into account in its eligibility assessment information on capital, leverage and liquidity ratios of individual institutions. Second, a new class of eligible assets, namely the “ non‑marketable debt instruments backed by eligible credit claims (DECCs)”, has been introduced in the Eurosystem collateral framework. DECCs are debt instruments that: (a) are backed by credit claims that are also eligible as collateral with the Eurosystem on an individual basis; and (b) that have a dual recourse feature, namely to: (i) the credit institution that is the originator of the underlying credit claims; and to (ii) the underlying credit claims themselves. It should be noted that, in the initial stage, only the domestic use of DECCs is envisaged. This restriction will remain in place until the Eurosystem fully develops the procedures for the cross-border use of DECCs. Guideline ECB/2015/27 is published on the ECB’s website for information purposes. The Guideline in 23 official EU languages is expected to be published in October 2015 in the Official Journal of the European Union.

"126","Roadmap for the future of the Economic and Monetary Union","Roadmap for the future of the Economic and Monetary Union 22 June 2015 Presidents of five EU institutions publish report on strengthening EMU Report to be presented to European Council on Thursday ECB President Mario Draghi calls for a quantum leap in integration The presidents of five European institutions today publish a report entitled “Completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union,” commissioned by leaders at the Euro Summit last October. The report, written by the presidents of the European Council, the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank, lays out a roadmap for further integration of the euro area. It will be presented to political leaders assembled in the European Council on Thursday. “The report describes how we can move from the current system of coordination by rules to joint decision-making within common institutions,” ECB President Mario Draghi said. “We need a quantum leap in European integration. We need to address the fragilities of our economies; to ensure that divergence will become convergence again; and to safeguard the irreversibility of monetary union. Our report provides the roadmap for this.” The report outlines ways to reinforce the foundation of the euro area in two phases. In the coming months, it suggests a process of “integration by doing” to make euro area economies more resilient and to shore up the euro area as a whole, in particular by completing banking union. The presidents advocate a swift agreement on a permanent common backstop for the Single Resolution Fund. They call for steps towards creating a European Deposit Insurance Scheme as a priority. The report also calls for the start of a new convergence process for all euro area Member States to achieve higher levels of resilience against shocks. The five presidents note that this convergence process will need to involve further sharing of sovereignty over key policies. This would mean moving to joint decision making in common institutions in these areas. At the end of this convergence process, the presidents propose setting up a fiscal stabilisation function for the euro area to insure each other more efficiently against shocks while avoiding permanent transfers between Member States. They also advocate eventually establishing a euro area treasury to jointly take decisions about certain elements of national budgets. In spring 2017, the European Commission will make specific proposals on how to pool sovereignty further. The presidents will be closely involved in the development of these proposals. The report calls on the European Council to endorse the proposals made as soon as possible. The full report is available on the ECB’s website.

The bond-buying programme was created in order to preserve the singleness of monetary policy in the euro area and ensure the transmission of the ECB’s policy stance to the real economy. The ECJ, which has jurisdiction over the ECB, found that OMTs fall within the scope of the ECB’s mandate of maintaining price stability. The Court has stated that the ECB must be allowed “broad discretion” when it “prepares and implements an open market operations programme” as it needs “to make choices of a technical nature and undertake forecasts and complex assessments.” For media queries, please contact Peter Ehrlich, tel.: +49 69 1344 8230.

"131","ECB announces publication of a new Guideline on the implementation of monetary policy","ECB announces publication of a new Guideline on the implementation of monetary policy 20 February 2015 Today the European Central Bank (ECB) has published a new Guideline (ECB/2014/60) on the implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy [1]. This Guideline will replace Guideline ECB/2011/14 [2], i.e. the current framework on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures, from 1 May 2015. [3] The new Guideline consolidates, simplifies and improves the clarity of the Eurosystem’s existing general framework for monetary policy implementation. For this purpose, it consolidates several amendments to the Eurosystem framework made since 2011 and updates cross-references to several Union legal acts, such as the CRR [4], the CRDIV [5] and the ESA 2010 [6]. Moreover, all provisions previously laid down in Annexes I and II to Guideline ECB/2011/14 (in particular Annex I, widely known as the “General Documentation”) have now been incorporated into the enacting terms of the new Guideline. The new Guideline introduces some changes to the framework, including: First, the provisions on open market operations have been revised to better align them with recently adopted practices and the Eurosystem’s flexibility in the conduct of open market operations (Title I, Part Two). In addition, the timeframe for the execution of standard and quick tenders has been amended to allow for more time for the publication of tender announcement and allotment messages. Second, the former classification of “international or supranational institutions” has been replaced with the concept of “multilateral development banks and international organizations” in order to align them with the definitions in other regulatory frameworks (Article 69); Third, several changes have been made to the eligibility criteria of asset-backed securities (ABS) aimed at enhancing the security and transparency of the debt instruments accepted by the Eurosystem, which will also contribute to improving the functioning of the ABS market, namely: exclusion of ABS comprising receivables with residual value – with a 4 month grandfathering period for those ABS that will be on the list of eligible assets on 1 May 2015 (Article 73.7); introduction of additional criteria for the place of incorporation of mortgage trustees or receivables trustees in ABS transactions – with a 1 year grandfathering period for those ABS that will be on the list of eligible assets on 1 May 2015 (Article 74.3); enhancement of the framework on ABS surveillance reports requirement (Article 88.2); further specification of the rules governing the provision of liquidity support in respect of ABS – these provisions shall apply as from 1 November 2015 (Article 142); removal of the requirements for counterparties to inform the Eurosystem of modifications to the ABS that took place in the preceding six months and of any planned modification to the ABS. Fourth, changes have been made to the rules governing the own-use of multi-cédulas issued after 1 May 2015 along with the clarification that the Eurosystem will consider the relation between each of the underlying cédulas issuers and respective counterparties for determining the existence of close links (Article 138). Fifth, provisions restricting the own-use of government guaranteed unsecured debt instruments have been clarified (Article 139). Guideline ECB/2014/60 is published on the ECB’s website for information purposes. The Guideline in 23 official EU languages is expected to be published in the course of April 2015 in the Official Journal of the European Union.

The waiver allowed these instruments to be used in Eurosystem monetary policy operations despite the fact that they did not fulfil minimum credit rating requirements. The Governing Council decision is based on the fact that it is currently not possible to assume a successful conclusion of the programme review and is in line with existing Eurosystem rules. This decision does not bear consequences for the counterparty status of Greek financial institutions in monetary policy operations. Liquidity needs of Eurosystem counterparties, for counterparties that do not have sufficient alternative collateral, can be satisfied by the relevant national central bank, by means of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) within the existing Eurosystem rules. The instruments in question will cease to be eligible as collateral as of the maturity of the current main refinancing operation (11 February 2015).

"133","ECB announces expanded asset purchase programme","ECB announces expanded asset purchase programme 22 January 2015 ECB expands purchases to include bonds issued by euro area central governments, agencies and European institutions Combined monthly asset purchases to amount to €60 billion Purchases intended to be carried out until at least September 2016 Programme designed to fulfil price stability mandate The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today announced an expanded asset purchase programme. Aimed at fulfilling the ECB’s price stability mandate, this programme will see the ECB add the purchase of sovereign bonds to its existing private sector asset purchase programmes in order to address the risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation. The Governing Council took this decision in a situation in which most indicators of actual and expected inflation in the euro area had drifted towards their historical lows. As potential second-round effects on wage and price-setting threatened to adversely affect medium-term price developments, this situation required a forceful monetary policy response. Asset purchases provide monetary stimulus to the economy in a context where key ECB interest rates are at their lower bound. They further ease monetary and financial conditions, making access to finance cheaper for firms and households. This tends to support investment and consumption, and ultimately contributes to a return of inflation rates towards 2%. The programme will encompass the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP) and the covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3), which were both launched late last year. Combined monthly purchases will amount to €60 billion. They are intended to be carried out until at least September 2016 and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The ECB will buy bonds issued by euro area central governments, agencies and European institutions in the secondary market against central bank money, which the institutions that sold the securities can use to buy other assets and extend credit to the real economy. In both cases, this contributes to an easing of financial conditions. The programme signals the Governing Council’s resolve to meet its objective of price stability in an unprecedented economic and financial environment. The instruments deployed are appropriate in the current circumstances and in full compliance with the EU Treaties. As regards the additional asset purchases, the Governing Council retains control over all the design features of the programme and the ECB will coordinate the purchases, thereby safeguarding the singleness of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy. The Eurosystem will make use of decentralised implementation to mobilise its resources. With regard to the sharing of hypothetical losses, the Governing Council decided that purchases of securities of European institutions (which will be 12% of the additional asset purchases, and which will be purchased by NCBs) will be subject to loss sharing. The rest of the NCBs’ additional asset purchases will not be subject to loss sharing. The ECB will hold 8% of the additional asset purchases. This implies that 20% of the additional asset purchases will be subject to a regime of risk sharing. For media queries, please contact Stefan Ruhkamp, tel.: +49 69 1344 5057. Notes: A technical annex is published alongside this press release with further operational details. TECHNICAL ANNEX ECB ANNOUNCES OPERATIONAL MODALITIES OF THE EXPANDED ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAMME The expanded asset purchase programme will comprise the ongoing purchase programmes for asset-backed securities (ABSPP) and covered bonds (CBPP3), and, as a new element, purchases of additional euro-denominated securities that meet the following eligibility criteria: They fulfil the collateral eligibility criteria for marketable assets in order to participate in Eurosystem monetary policy operations, as specified in Guideline ECB/2011/14, as amended, subject to the fulfilment of the additional criteria listed in points 2-4 below. They are issued by an entity established in the euro area classified in one of the following categories: central government, certain agencies established in the euro area or certain international or supranational institutions located in the euro area. They have a first-best credit assessment from an external credit assessment institution of at least CQS3 for the issuer or the guarantor, provided the guarantee is eligible in accordance with Guideline ECB/2011/14, as amended. Securities that do not achieve the CQS3 rating will be eligible, as long as the Eurosystem’s minimum credit quality threshold is not applied for the purpose of their collateral eligibility. Moreover, during reviews in the context of financial assistance programmes for a euro area Member State, eligibility would be suspended and would resume only in the event of a positive outcome of the review. Inflation-linked and floating rate securities issued by central governments, certain agencies established in the euro area and certain international or supranational institutions located in the euro area are eligible for purchase under the expanded asset purchase programme. All eligibility criteria and other modalities of the ABSPP and CBPP3 remain unaltered under the programme. In addition it was decided that: Securities purchased under the expanded asset purchase programme that are not covered by the ABSPP or CBPP3 must have a minimum remaining maturity of 2 years and a maximum remaining maturity of 30 years at the time of purchase. Securities purchased under the expanded asset purchase programme that are not covered by the ABSPP or CBPP3 will be subject to an issue limit, an aggregate holding limit and other operational modalities specified, in particular, with the aim of preserving market functioning and allowing the formation of a market price on a given security. Moreover, the limits ensure that the application of collective action clauses for a bondholder decision is not obstructed. Regarding creditor treatment, the Eurosystem accepts the same (pari passu) treatment as private investors with respect to securities purchased by the Eurosystem, in accordance with the terms of such securities. Purchases of securities under the expanded asset purchase programme that are not covered by the ABSPP or CBPP3 will be allocated across issuers from the various euro area countries on the basis of the ECB’s capital key. Holdings of securities issued by central governments, certain agencies established in the euro area and certain international or supranational institutions located in the euro area will be valued at amortised cost, in line with Guideline ECB/2010/20 on the legal framework for accounting and financial reporting in the ESCB, as amended. The eligible counterparties for purchases shall be those eligible for the Eurosystem’s monetary policy instruments, together with any other counterparties used by the Eurosystem for the investment of its euro-denominated portfolios. Holdings of securities issued by central governments, certain agencies established in the euro area and certain international or supranational institutions located in the euro area purchased under the expanded asset purchase programme will be eligible for securities lending. Transactions in securities purchased under the programme will be published in a weekly report which will list holdings at amortised cost by asset type. In addition, for securities purchased under the expanded asset purchase programme that are not covered by the ABSPP or CBPP3, a report of the amounts held, valued at amortised cost, and the weighted average remaining maturity by issuer residence will be released on a monthly basis.

"134","ECB announces a modification to the interest rate applicable to future targeted longer-term refinancing operations","ECB announces a modification to the interest rate applicable to future targeted longer-term refinancing operations 22 January 2015 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided today that the interest rate for the remaining six targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) would be equal to the rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations (MROs) prevailing at the time when each TLTRO is conducted. With this decision, the 10 basis point spread over the MRO rate which was applied in the first two TLTROs is eliminated for the TLTROs to be conducted between March 2015 and June 2016. This decision supports the effectiveness of the operations by reflecting the reduction in term premia on market-based funding instruments for banks that has been observed since the announcement of the TLTROs on 5 June 2014. Today’s decision confirms the intention of the Governing Council to underpin the effectiveness of the TLTROs as key instruments supporting lending to the non-financial private sector, thereby enhancing monetary policy transmission and reinforcing the accommodative monetary policy stance. The change will be implemented in an amendment to the Decision of the ECB of 29 July 2014 on measures relating to targeted longer-term refinancing operations (ECB/2014/34) which will be published before the next TLTRO operation in March 2015.

The appointed companies are: Amundi and Amundi Intermédiation; Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management International; ING Investment Management; State Street Global Advisors. Their appointment followed a competitive negotiated tender procedure. The executing asset managers’ role will be to conduct the eligible ABS purchase transactions on explicit instructions from, and on behalf of, the Eurosystem, which will undertake price checks and due diligence prior to approving the transactions. The contracts with the executing asset managers contain a number of provisions to mitigate conflicts of interest, such as the separation of teams working for the ECB and those engaged in any other activities. This will be subject to checks by external auditors. The purchases under the ABSPP are expected to start in November 2014, following the approval by the Governing Council of a legal act on the implementation of the programme. Once approved, the act will be published on the ECB’s website and will enter into force on the day following its publication. The ABSPP is one of a number of measures taken by the Governing Council to facilitate the provision of credit to the euro area economy, generate positive spill-overs to other markets and, as a result, ease the ECB’s monetary policy stance.

"142","Statement on New York Times articles","Statement on New York Times articles 17 October 2014 The ECB neither provides nor approves emergency liquidity assistance. It is the national central bank, in this case the Central Bank of Cyprus, that provides ELA to an institution that it judges to be solvent at its own risks and under its own terms and conditions. The ECB can object on monetary policy grounds; in order to do so at least two thirds of the Governing Council must see the provision of emergency liquidity as interfering with the tasks and objectives of euro area monetary policy. In this specific case there was full consensus in the Governing Council on the need to get assurances from the Central Bank of Cyprus that this bank was solvent. This was confirmed explicitly by the Central Bank of Cyprus, which also confirmed the proper valuation of collateral after an intense dialogue between it and the ECB. The ECB was not the supervisor and fully relied on the assessment of the Central Bank of Cyprus. Therefore to draw conclusions about the ECB’s future banking supervision role on the basis of ELA to Cyprus is tendentious.

Together with the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the purchase programmes will further enhance the transmission of monetary policy. They will facilitate credit provision to the euro area economy, generate positive spill-overs to other markets and, as a result, ease the ECB’s monetary policy stance. These measures will have a sizeable impact on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet and will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to 2%. The Eurosystem’s collateral framework – the rules that lay out which assets are acceptable as collateral for monetary policy credit operations – will be the guiding principle for deciding the eligibility of assets to be bought under the ABS purchase programme (ABSPP) and covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3). There will be some adjustments to take into account the difference between accepting assets as collateral and buying assets outright. To ensure that the programmes can include the whole euro area, ABSs and covered bonds from Greece and Cyprus that are currently not eligible as collateral for monetary policy operations will be subject to specific rules with risk-mitigating measures. The two programmes will last for at least two years and are likely to have a stimulating effect on issuance. Asset purchases will commence in the fourth quarter of 2014, starting with covered bonds in the second half of October. The ABSPP will start after external service providers have been selected, following an ongoing procurement process. Further technical details on the ABSPP are provided in Annex 1 of this press release and on CBPP3 in Annex 2. For media inquiries, please contact Stefan Ruhkamp on +49 69 1344 5057.

The programme is designed to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism by supporting bank lending to the real economy. In order to participate in the tender that was announced on 16 September, credit institutions had to express their interest and send completed reporting templates by 28 August. A total of 382 entities were eligible to bid in the first TLTRO, representing, either directly or indirectly, 1372 credit institutions. Additional counterparties that intend to participate in the second TLTRO in December will have to send completed reporting templates by 20 November 2014, 3.30 p.m. CET. The second TLTRO, as previously communicated, will be announced on 9 December and allotted on 11 December. In the first two tenders, banks and groups of banks are entitled to an initial borrowing allowance equal to 7% of the total amount of their loans to the euro area non-financial private sector, excluding loans to households for house purchase, outstanding on 30 April 2014. Therefore, eligible banks who have not reached their initial allowance limit in the first TLTRO will be able to increase their initial borrowing amount up to that limit in the second TLTRO. Thereafter, banks will be able to apply for additional funding, depending on the evolution of their lending activities against a specific benchmark. The TLTROs, first announced on 5 June, together with measures announced on 4 September related to the purchase of non-financial private sector assets, will have a sizeable impact on the ECB’s balance sheet.

As of 1 October 2014, auto loan, leasing, consumer finance and credit card ABSs for which the mandatory level of compliance with reporting requirements has not been attained and for which the data provider has neither given an explanation for that non-compliance nor provided an action plan for achieving full compliance, will become ineligible for use as Eurosystem collateral. Additionally, the Governing Council has decided that, as of 1 October 2014, the Eurosystem may temporarily accept non-compliant auto loan, leasing, consumer finance and credit card ABSs as eligible collateral, on a case-by-case basis and subject to the provision of adequate explanations for the failure to achieve the mandatory score required. For each adequate explanation, the Eurosystem will specify its tolerance stance. These decisions will help secure a smooth transition to full compliance while ensuring a level playing field between different classes of ABSs at different stages of the compliance process. Further details of the ABS loan-level initiative, including the above-mentioned modifications, are available via the ECB’s dedicated web pages.

The Governing Council decided this month that meetings dedicated to monetary policy will be held every six weeks instead of once in a month, starting in January 2015. As a consequence, the maintenance periods will be extended to about six weeks as well. The new calendar aligns the start of maintenance periods with possible implementation of monetary policy decisions.

"152","ECB announces further details of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations","ECB announces further details of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations 3 July 2014 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided today on further technical details of a series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), announced on 5 June 2014. The TLTROs are designed to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism by supporting bank lending to the real economy. Under the scheme, banks will initially be able to borrow an amount equivalent to up to 7% of a specific part of their loans in two operations in September and December 2014. After this, additional amounts can be borrowed in further TLTROs, depending on the evolution of the banks’ eligible lending activities in excess of bank-specific benchmarks. The additional borrowing allowance is limited to three times the difference between the net lending since 30 April 2014 and the benchmark at the time it is claimed. The Governing Council decided today that: For banks [1] that exhibited positive eligible net lending in the twelve-month period to 30 April 2014, the benchmarks are always set at zero. For banks that exhibited negative eligible net lending in the year to 30 April 2014, different benchmarks apply. These are set as follows: the average monthly net lending of each bank in the year to 30 April 2014 is extrapolated for 12 months until 30 April 2015. For the year from 30 April 2015 to 30 April 2016, the benchmark monthly net lending is set at zero. Banks that borrow in the TLTROs and fail to achieve their benchmarks as at 30 April 2016 will be required to pay back their borrowings in full in September 2016. Banks participating in a TLTRO will be subject to specific reporting obligations. The initial operations will be conducted on 18 September and 11 December 2014, with the additional operations carried out in March, June, September and December 2015 and in March and June 2016. Further technical details of the TLTROs can be found in an annex to this press release. By the beginning of August 2014 the ECB will publish a legal act that will form the basis of the series of TLTROs. For media queries, please call Wiktor Krzyżanowski on +49 69 1344 5755. [1]Banks can participate in a TLTRO individually. In addition, several banks may form a “TLTRO group”, if they fulfil specific conditions, and can then participate in a TLTRO through one member of the group. In this case, the calculation of the TLTRO group’s benchmark and borrowing allowances will be based on aggregated loan data for the TLTRO group.

The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB), in cooperation with the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, has decided to continue to offer one-week US dollar liquidity-providing operations after 31 July 2014 until further notice. In the future the ECB will, on a regular basis, assess the need for US dollar liquidity-providing operations. It will take into account the fact that the recently established standing swap lines have created a framework for the provision of US dollar liquidity to counterparties, if warranted by market conditions. The indicative schedule for US dollar liquidity-providing operations for the next three months will be published on the ECB’s website and will be updated on a monthly basis. The operations take the form of repurchase transactions against eligible collateral and are carried out as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The earlier decision to continue to conduct one-week US dollar liquidity-providing operations until 31 July 2014 was announced by the ECB on 24 January 2014, when the Governing Council also announced that after April 2014 it would no longer offer three-month US dollar liquidity-providing operations.

The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. In addition, the Governing Council has decided to discontinue the Eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, following the operation to be allotted on 10 June 2014.

"156","ECB announces monetary policy measures to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism","ECB announces monetary policy measures to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism 5 June 2014 In pursuing its price stability mandate, the Governing Council of the ECB has today announced measures to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism by supporting lending to the real economy. In particular, the Governing Council has decided: To conduct a series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) aimed at improving bank lending to the euro area non-financial private sector [1], excluding loans to households for house purchase, over a window of two years. To intensify preparatory work related to outright purchases of asset-backed securities (ABS). Modalities of the series of TLTROs Counterparties will be entitled to an initial TLTRO borrowing allowance (initial allowance) equal to 7% of the total amount of their loans to the euro area non-financial private sector, excluding loans to households for house purchase, outstanding on 30 April 2014. In two successive TLTROs to be conducted in September and December 2014, counterparties will be able to borrow an amount that cumulatively does not exceed this initial allowance. During the period from March 2015 to June 2016, all counterparties will be able to borrow additional amounts in a series of TLTROs conducted quarterly. These additional amounts can cumulatively reach up to three times each counterparty’s net lending [2] to the euro area non-financial private sector, excluding loans to households for house purchase, provided between 30 April 2014 and the respective allotment reference date [3] in excess of a specified benchmark. The benchmark will be determined by taking into account each counterparty’s net lending to the euro area non-financial private sector, excluding loans to households for house purchase, recorded in the 12-month period up to 30 April 2014. All TLTROs will mature in September 2018. The interest rate on the TLTROs will be fixed over the life of each operation at the rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations (MROs) prevailing at the time of take-up, plus a fixed spread of 10 basis points. Interest will be paid in arrears when the borrowing is repaid. Starting 24 months after each TLTRO, counterparties will have the option to repay any part of the amounts they were allotted in that TLTRO at a six-monthly frequency. Counterparties that have borrowed under the TLTROs and whose net lending to the euro area non-financial private sector, excluding loans to households for house purchase, in the period from 1 May 2014 to 30 April 2016 is below the benchmark will be required to pay back borrowings in September 2016. Further technical details and an exact calendar of the operations will be announced in due course. Intensification of preparatory work related to outright purchases of ABS The Governing Council has decided to intensify preparatory work related to outright purchases in the ABS market to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, given the role of this market in facilitating new credit flows to the economy. Under this initiative, the Eurosystem will consider purchasing simple and transparent ABS with underlying assets consisting of claims against the euro area non-financial private sector, taking into account the desirable changes in the regulatory environment, and will work with other relevant institutions to that effect. The Eurosystem will work out the appropriate modalities for this policy measure, including the key requirements that the ABS will have to meet in order to be eligible. Further details of the initiative will be announced in due course. For media queries, please call Michael Steen on +49 69 1344 7457 or Stefan Ruhkamp on +49 69 1344 5057 [1]The euro area non-financial private sector is defined as euro area households and non-financial corporations. [2]Net lending will be measured on the basis of the transactions concept of the BSI statistics, i.e. new loans minus loan redemptions, adjusted for the impact of loan sales and securitisations. [3]The allotment reference date is defined as the most recent month for which net lending data will be available for each TLTRO allotment.

"168","Results of the Euro Money Market Survey 2013","Results of the Euro Money Market Survey 2013 6 November 2013 Today, the European Central Bank (ECB) is publishing the results of the “Euro Money Market Survey 2013”, which highlights the main developments in the euro money market in the second quarter of 2013, comparing them with those in the second quarter of 2012. The results of this year’s survey, which are derived from a constant panel of 104 banks (unless otherwise indicated; see the notes below), show the following: Aggregate turnover in the segments of the euro money markets captured by the survey expanded by 3%, to €75 trillion, after having decreased by 18% last year. In the unsecured market, cash borrowing of the banks on the panel decreased by 44%, to €1.75 trillion, while their lending declined by 17%, to €1.46 trillion. Total trading activity remained concentrated on maturities of one week or less. Overnight transactions accounted for 67% of total borrowing and for 86% of all lending activity, remaining more or less unchanged this year. The secured market remained the largest segment. Total turnover in secured lending and borrowing rose by 17%, to €30 trillion, mainly on account of a 27% increase in activity relating to overnight maturities, while turnover for maturities of between “tomorrow/next” and one week increased by 16%. Trading in longer maturities accounted for less than 7% of total secured trading. 71% of all bilateral repo transactions were cleared by central counterparties, compared with a revised figure of 56% in 2012. Activity in the derivative segments covered by the survey remained broadly unchanged. Expressed as percentages, the most significant changes in activity were observed in cross-currency swaps (where turnover decreased by 26%) and in interest rate swaps other than foreign exchange and cross currency swaps (where turnover increased by 21%). Taking into account the feedback received from all of the 161 banks surveyed, the unsecured market remained the least concentrated segment, with 20% of the banks accounting for 87% of the transactions, while interest rate swaps became the most concentrated, with 20% of the banks accounting for 99.5% of the transactions. Reported turnover in the outright secondary market for short-term paper was 11% lower than in the previous year. Turnover for short-term paper issued by credit institutions increased by 10%, while turnover in government issues reported by the surveyed banks decreased by 22%. Electronic trading decreased in most money market segments, while other forms of trading increased in most of them. The qualitative part of the survey shows that perceived efficiency and liquidity conditions in the unsecured market improved only marginally and remain rather low. As regards the secured market, perceived efficiency and liquidity conditions improved marginally as well, but from higher levels than the unsecured market. For most other market segments, clearer improvements of perceived efficiency were reported in 2013, although it was generally felt that liquidity conditions had not become better. This year’s survey also covered prospective questions, as were reported for the first time in the 2012 survey. Participants were asked to assess how their interbank trading volumes or the number of their counterparties were expected to evolve in the light of expected changes to the risk limits. The overall results suggest that conditions are stabilising: compared with 2012, more of the 161 responding banks expect that limits will not be changed. Expectations of both reductions and increases in limits declined. Notes This survey has been conducted on an annual basis since 1999, and always compares data for the second quarter of the current year with data for the second quarter of the previous year. It is prepared by experts from the European System of Central Banks, i.e. the ECB and the national central banks of the European Union. The survey uses a constant panel of 104 banks wherever longer-term comparisons are made, but also includes data provided by the full panel of banks, which has grown over time, in order to obtain a more complete picture of the market. The full panel currently comprises 161 banks. The “Euro Money Market Survey 2013” can be downloaded from the ECB’s website ( http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money/mmss/html/index.en.html), together with a summarised version of the survey data (CSV file). The full dataset is available in the ECB’s Statistical Data Warehouse. For the first time this year, the Money Market Survey reports total turnover data, i.e. cumulative turnover during the period in question, instead of daily average volumes. The new reporting methodology resulted in some revisions to the figures of 2012. For media queries, please contact William Lelieveldt, Tel.: +49 69 1344 7316.

"169","ECB establishes standing swap arrangements with other central banks","ECB establishes standing swap arrangements with other central banks 31 October 2013 The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank announced on Thursday that their existing temporary bilateral liquidity swap arrangements are being converted to standing arrangements, that is, arrangements that will remain in place until further notice. The standing arrangements will constitute a network of bilateral swap lines among the six central banks. These arrangements allow for the provision of liquidity in each jurisdiction in any of the five currencies foreign to that jurisdiction, should the two central banks in a particular bilateral swap arrangement judge that market conditions warrant such action in one of their currencies. The existing temporary swap arrangements have helped to ease strains in financial markets and mitigate their effects on economic conditions. The standing arrangements will continue to serve as a prudent liquidity backstop. European Central Bank decision The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided on this conversion into standing arrangements in cooperation with the other five above-mentioned central banks. This will enable the Eurosystem to continue to provide euro to those central banks when required and to provide to its counterparties, when necessary, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs and Canadian dollars in addition to the existing liquidity-providing operations in US dollars. The ECB will continue to conduct regular US dollar liquidity-providing operations with maturities of approximately seven days and three months until further notice. The indicative schedule for these operations is published on the ECB’s website. The operations take the form of repurchase transactions against eligible collateral and are carried out as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The ECB may adjust the frequency and maturity of its US dollar liquidity-providing operations in view of changing market conditions. Information on the actions to be taken by other central banks is available on the following websites: Bank of Canada ( http://www.bankofcanada.ca) Bank of England ( http://www.bankofengland.co.uk) Bank of Japan ( http://www.boj.or.jp/en) Federal Reserve ( http://www.federalreserve.gov) Swiss National Bank ( http://www.snb.ch) For media queries, please contact William Lelieveldt, tel. +49 69 1344 7455.

Agreement will be valid for three years. From the Eurosystem’s perspective, it will serve as a backstop liquidity facility. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the People’s Bank of China (PBC) have agreed to establish a bilateral currency swap arrangement to purchase and subsequently repurchase Chinese yuan and euro from each other. The swap agreement, which will be valid for three years, will have a maximum size of 350 billion yuan when yuan are provided to the ECB and of €45 billion when euro are provided to the PBC. The swap arrangement has been established in the context of rapidly growing bilateral trade and investment between the euro area and China, as well as the need to ensure the stability of financial markets. From the perspective of the Eurosystem, the swap arrangement is intended to serve as a backstop liquidity facility and to reassure euro area banks of the continuous provision of Chinese yuan. It has been established at the level of the Eurosystem and will be available to all Eurosystem counterparties via national central banks. The Governing Council will, in due course, discuss the technical modalities with which this backstop liquidity facility will be made available and how these technical modalities will be communicated.

"177","ECB further reviews its risk control framework allowing for a new treatment of asset-backed securities","ECB further reviews its risk control framework allowing for a new treatment of asset-backed securities 18 July 2013 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to further strengthen its risk control framework. To maintain adequate risk protection, the ECB regularly adjusts its collateral eligibility rules and haircuts applied when accepting collateral in Eurosystem monetary policy operations. In addition, some measures aim to improve the overall consistency of the framework. At the same time, the list of collateral accepted under the permanent Eurosystem collateral framework will be expanded. These measures taken together have an overall neutral effect on the amount of collateral available. In the biennial review of its risk control framework applied in Eurosystem monetary policy operations, the Governing Council decided in particular to: Update the haircuts for marketable and non-marketable instruments; Adjust the risk control measures for retained covered bonds to take into account the additional risk which results from the use of such securities by the issuer itself and to ensure a level playing field between securities with comparable risks; Replace the current requirement of two ‘triple A’ ratings with the requirement of two ‘single A’ ratings for the six classes of asset-backed securities (ABS) subject to loan level reporting requirements, reflecting their improved transparency and standardisation; Reduce the haircuts applicable to ABS eligible under the permanent and temporary Eurosystem collateral framework. In addition, the Governing Council has adjusted the eligibility criteria and haircuts applied by National Central Banks (NCBs) to pools of credit claims and certain types of the additional credit claims (ACC) eligible under the temporary Eurosystem collateral framework. The amendments will lead to more consistency of the ACC framework and is expected to generate collateral gains without affecting the overall risk contribution of ACCs. Besides the adjustments to the risk control framework, the ECB will continue to investigate how to catalyse recent initiatives by European institutions to improve funding conditions for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), in particular as regards the possible acceptance of SME linked ABS guaranteed mezzanine tranches as Eurosystem collateral in line with established guarantee policies. The Governing Council reserves the right to limit or exclude the use of certain assets as collateral in its credit operations, also at the level of individual counterparties. These measures will come into force once formalised with the relevant Eurosystem legal acts and/or national implementing provisions. Further details about the new haircut schedules can be obtained via the Annex to this press release.

"186","ECB announces changes to the use as collateral of certain uncovered government-guaranteed bank bonds","ECB announces changes to the use as collateral of certain uncovered government-guaranteed bank bonds 22 March 2013 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has adopted Decision ECB/2013/6, which prevents, as of 1 March 2015, the use as collateral in Eurosystem monetary policy operations of uncovered government-guaranteed bank bonds that have been issued by the counterparty itself or an entity closely linked to that counterparty. As of that date, the Eurosystem will also no longer accept covered bonds issued by the counterparty where the asset pool contains uncovered government-guaranteed bank bonds also issued by that counterparty or an entity closely linked to that counterparty. This Decision, which aims to ensure the equal treatment of counterparties in Eurosystem monetary policy operations and simplify the relevant legal provisions, follows the measures implemented on 3 July 2012, which limited counterparties’ use of uncovered government-guaranteed bank bonds that they themselves have issued. Until 28 February 2015, counterparties may submit as collateral uncovered government‑guaranteed bank bonds that they themselves have issued, up to the nominal value of these bonds, as approved by the Governing Council on 3 July 2012. The Governing Council has also decided to amend the rules on the use of uncovered government-guaranteed bank bonds for the period until 28 February 2015. As a result, the national central banks of the Eurosystem will now only be allowed to reject eligible uncovered government-guaranteed bank bonds as collateral if they have been issued by the counterparty itself and do not comply with the Eurosystem’s minimum credit rating threshold. This decision has been implemented by means of the recasting of Guideline ECB/2012/18. In the interests of clarity and simplicity, the recast Guideline ECB/2013/4 now also includes the provisions of other existing legal acts on temporary measures (namely Decisions ECB/2011/4, ECB/2011/10, ECB/2012/32 and ECB/2012/34).

"193","ECB extends the existing swap arrangements with other central banks","ECB extends the existing swap arrangements with other central banks 13 December 2012 The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing an extension of the existing temporary US dollar liquidity swap arrangements until 1 February 2014. Previously, these swap arrangements had been authorised until 1 February 2013. These central banks are also extending until 1 February 2014 the network of temporary bilateral liquidity swap arrangements that enable the provision of liquidity in each jurisdiction in any of their currencies, should market conditions so warrant. Previously, these bilateral liquidity swap arrangements had been authorised until 1 February 2013. The Bank of Japan will consider the extension of both sets of swap arrangements at its next monetary policy meeting. European Central Bank decision The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided in cooperation with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve and the Swiss National Bank to extend the temporary network of reciprocal swap lines until 1 February 2014. This action will enable the Eurosystem to continue to provide euro to those central banks when required and to provide to its counterparties, when necessary, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs and Canadian dollars (in addition to the existing liquidity-providing operations in US dollars). The Governing Council also decided that the ECB will, until further notice, continue to conduct regular US dollar liquidity-providing operations with maturities of approximately one week and three months. The indicative schedule for these operations, which will take the form of repurchase transactions against eligible collateral and will be carried out as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment, will be published on the ECB’s website.

"196","ECB publishes amendments of the General Documentation","ECB publishes amendments of the General Documentation 28 November 2012 The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published an amendment to “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” (recast) (ECB/2011/14), often referred to as the “General Documentation” (GD). In addition to a number of technical adjustments, with the aim of streamlining and strengthening the collateral and risk control framework in place for Eurosystem operations, the Guideline published today includes the following changes: First, as announced on 6 July 2012, the reporting requirements related to the loan-level data for asset-backed securities have been laid down in Section 6.2.1.1 and in the new Appendix 8. Second, the Eurosystem has streamlined the coupon types of eligible marketable instruments (Section 6.2.1.1). Specifically, floating-rate coupons must be linked to a single standard euro interest rate reference or to a euro area inflation index. Complex coupon structures and inverse floaters are excluded. Third, the Eurosystem has established (Section 6.2.1.1) that the cover pools of eligible covered bonds may only contain asset-backed securities to the extent that these comply with Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC, were originated within the same consolidated group and are used for transferring mortgages to the covered bond issuing entity. A grandfathering period of two years (starting as of 3 Jan 2013) for already issued covered bonds has been put in place. Fourth, the acceptance of unrated UCITS-compliant covered bonds issued prior to 1 January 2008 has been phased out (Section 6.3.2). Fifth, the Governing Council has decided to amend the close-link provisions in place for the own-use of covered bonds as collateral (Section 6.2.3.2). Henceforth, only the following covered bonds will be eligible for own-use: covered bank bonds issued in accordance with the criteria set out in Annex VI, Part 1, points 68 to 70 of Directive 2006/48/EC, or covered bank bonds issued in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 52(4) of the UCITS Directive (Directive 2009/65/EC) and offering comparable protection to the criteria set out in Annex VI, Part 1, point 68 to 70 of Directive 2006/48/EC. Sixth, the Governing Council has decided (Section 6.3.4.4) that the providers of credit assessment systems accepted within the Eurosystem Credit Assessment Framework (ECAF) will be required to submit performance monitoring data on a disaggregated basis. Also, credit assessment systems will be required to provide a signed certificate confirming the accuracy and validity of the performance monitoring information provided. Seventh, a new information requirement for counterparties has been established (Section 6.2.3) which places the onus on the counterparty to inform the Eurosystem (i) one month in advance of any planned modification to an asset-backed security which it has submitted as collateral and (ii) upon submission of an asset-backed security, of any modification made to that asset in the six months prior to its submission, if the asset-backed security is own-used. The Guideline amending Guideline ECB/2011/14 will apply from 3 January 2013 and can be found on the ECB’s website.

In order to ensure that all the necessary amendments will have been made to Guideline ECB/2011/14 at the national level, the Governing Council of the ECB has decided to adjust this timeline as follows: For residential mortgage-backed securities, the reporting requirements will be mandatory as of 3 January 2013. For asset-backed securities, where the cash-flow generating assets comprise loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, the reporting requirements will be mandatory as of 3 January 2013. For commercial mortgage-backed securities, the reporting requirements will be mandatory as of 1 March 2013. The nine-month transitional phase for each asset class, starting on the dates indicated above, will also be adjusted accordingly. These slight postponements will allow for the smooth implementation of the necessary amendments. For other asset classes (i.e. auto loans, consumer finance loans and leasing receivables) the date of entry into force remains as originally announced, namely 1 January 2014.

"199","Ending of covered bond purchase programme 2 (CBPP2)","Ending of covered bond purchase programme 2 (CBPP2) 31 October 2012 Today, the CBPP2 ends as scheduled. On 6 October 2011, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) had decided on the CBPP2, the technical modalities of which were published on 3 November 2011. The purchases of covered bonds commenced in November 2011. The aim of the programme was to contribute (a) to easing funding conditions for credit institutions and enterprises and (b) to encouraging credit institutions to maintain and expand their lending to customers. The initially targeted total nominal amount of purchases was €40 billion, and the purchases were expected to have been carried out in full by 31 October 2012. As already announced at the press conference of 4 April 2012, the ECB had slowed down the pace of purchases in response both to investors’ increasing demand for euro area covered bonds and to the decline in the supply of covered bonds. Accordingly, a nominal amount of €16.418 billion was purchased on the primary and secondary markets between November 2011 and October 2012. The Eurosystem central banks intend to keep these covered bonds until maturity. Should the Governing Council deem it to be appropriate to reopen the programme, this will be communicated in advance. More information on the breakdown of acquisitions under the CBPP2 by primary and secondary market purchase is provided on the ECB’s website.

"200","ECB publishes the 2012 Structural Issues Report on “Euro area labour markets and the crisis”","ECB publishes the 2012 Structural Issues Report on “Euro area labour markets and the crisis” 8 October 2012 The European Central Bank (ECB) is publishing its 2012 Structural Issues Report today. This year the report focuses on “Euro area labour markets and the crisis”. The report aims to explain the heterogeneity in the labour market adjustment across euro area countries during the crisis and to assess the potential medium-term consequences and policy implications of these developments. In particular, the report shows that the reactions to the crisis across countries reflect not only differences in the severity of the crisis and in labour market institutions, but also the different nature of the shocks hitting euro area economies and the presence of imbalances in the run-up to the crisis. In addition, relatively limited wage adjustment has been observed in euro area countries despite the severity of the crisis, which points to downward wage rigidities. In terms of the medium-term consequences of the crisis, the significant rise in skill disparities between labour demand and supply suggests that this increasing mismatch is one of the biggest challenges facing some euro area labour markets. Available estimates also show a recent marked upward trend in structural unemployment. A flexible response of wages to labour market conditions should be a key priority in euro area labour markets. This would facilitate the necessary sectoral reallocation and support sustainable job creation and reductions in unemployment. Further major labour market reforms are therefore necessary to increase the flexibility of employment and wages across the euro area countries in order to reduce the risk of a permanent increase in structural unemployment and a decrease in potential output growth. This reform strategy is also a key ingredient for a solid economic recovery in euro area economies, which would also contribute to the correction and prevention of macroeconomic imbalances and fiscal consolidation. Greater flexibility in euro area labour markets would reduce the adjustment costs associated with economic shocks and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of monetary policy. Furthermore, if the benefits of labour market reforms are to be reaped in full, reforms must be accompanied by wide-ranging product market reforms. The Structural Issues Report, which is prepared by a task force of the Monetary Policy Committee of the European System of Central Banks under the aegis of the ECB’s Governing Council, identifies a topic on structural aspects of the euro area economy relevant for monetary policy. The report analyses this topic from a euro area and cross-country perspective, based on input from the staff of the ECB and of the ESCB national central banks. The full report is available on the ECB’s website.

"202","ECB publishes the results of the Euro Money Market Survey 2012","ECB publishes the results of the Euro Money Market Survey 2012 28 September 2012 Today the European Central Bank (ECB) is publishing the results of the “Euro Money Market Survey 2012”, which highlights the main developments in the euro money market in the second quarter of 2012, comparing them with the second quarter of 2011. The results of this year’s survey, which are derived from a constant panel of 105 banks (unless otherwise indicated; see the notes below), show the following. Aggregate turnover in the euro money market (i.e. lending and borrowing combined) contracted by 14%, after a strong increase last year. In the unsecured market, the cash borrowing of the banks on the panel decreased by 38%, while their lending decreased by 31%. Total activity remained concentrated in maturities of one month or less. Overnight transactions accounted for 66% of total borrowing activity, compared with 73% in 2011. 83% of lending transactions were overnight transactions, a year-on-year increase of 4 percentage points. The secured market remained the largest segment, although turnover declined by 15%, mainly on account of a 26% decrease in activity for the overnight maturity; turnover for maturities of between “tomorrow/next” and one month declined by 11%. 55% of secured market transactions were cleared by central counterparties, compared with a revised figure of 51% in the second quarter of 2011. Activity in the derivative segments covered by the survey decreased by 9%. In percentage terms, the most significant reductions in activity were observed in overnight index swaps (where turnover decreased by 50%) and other interest rate swaps (where turnover decreased by 16%). In contrast, turnover for foreign exchange swaps increased again, rising by 12%, while turnover for forward rate agreements rose by 4%. The unsecured market remained the least concentrated segment, while other interest rate swaps became the most concentrated. Turnover in the outright secondary market for short-term paper was 9% lower than in the previous year, although turnover for short-term paper issued by credit institutions increased by 12%. The percentage of direct trading decreased in most segments, with the exception of the unsecured segment and outright transactions. Electronic trading increased in most money market segments, but declined in cross-currency swaps and outright transactions. The qualitative part of the survey shows that efficiency in the unsecured market was deemed to have worsened markedly in comparison with 2011. Liquidity conditions were also perceived to have deteriorated. As regards the secured segment, the number of respondents giving a positive assessment of the market’s efficiency increased, although liquidity conditions were perceived as being worse than in 2011. For most other market segments, the perception of efficiency was more positive in 2012, whereas it was generally felt that liquidity conditions had deteriorated. Notes This survey has been conducted on an annual basis since 1999 and always compares data for the second quarter of the current year with data for the second quarter of the previous year. It is conducted by experts from the European System of Central Banks, i.e. the ECB and the national central banks of the European Union. The survey uses a constant panel of 105 banks wherever longer-term comparisons are made, but also includes data provided by the full panel of banks, which has grown over time, in order to obtain a more complete picture of the market. The full panel currently comprises 172 banks. The “Euro Money Market Survey 2012” can be downloaded from the ECB’s website, together with a summarised version of the survey data (CSV file).

"204","Measures to preserve collateral availability","Measures to preserve collateral availability 6 September 2012 On 6 September 2012 the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided on additional measures to preserve collateral availability for counterparties in order to maintain their access to the Eurosystem’s liquidity-providing operations. Change in eligibility for central government assets The Governing Council of the ECB has decided to suspend the application of the minimum credit rating threshold in the collateral eligibility requirements for the purposes of the Eurosystem’s credit operations in the case of marketable debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the central government, and credit claims granted to or guaranteed by the central government, of countries that are eligible for Outright Monetary Transactions or are under an EU-IMF programme and comply with the attached conditionality as assessed by the Governing Council. The suspension applies to all outstanding and new assets of the type described above. The decision on the collateral eligibility of bonds issued or guaranteed by the Greek government taken by the Governing Council on 18 July 2012 is still applicable (Decision ECB/2012/14). Expansion of the list of assets eligible to be used as collateral The Governing Council of the ECB has also decided that marketable debt instruments denominated in currencies other than the euro, namely the US dollar, the pound sterling and the Japanese yen, and issued and held in the euro area, are eligible to be used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations until further notice. This measure reintroduces a similar decision that was applicable between October 2008 and December 2010, with appropriate valuation markdowns. These measures will come into force with the relevant legal acts.

"205","Technical features of Outright Monetary Transactions","Technical features of Outright Monetary Transactions 6 September 2012 As announced on 2 August 2012, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has today taken decisions on a number of technical features regarding the Eurosystem’s outright transactions in secondary sovereign bond markets that aim at safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy. These will be known as Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) and will be conducted within the following framework: Conditionality A necessary condition for Outright Monetary Transactions is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) programme. Such programmes can take the form of a full EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a precautionary programme (Enhanced Conditions Credit Line), provided that they include the possibility of EFSF/ESM primary market purchases. The involvement of the IMF shall also be sought for the design of the country-specific conditionality and the monitoring of such a programme. The Governing Council will consider Outright Monetary Transactions to the extent that they are warranted from a monetary policy perspective as long as programme conditionality is fully respected, and terminate them once their objectives are achieved or when there is non-compliance with the macroeconomic adjustment or precautionary programme. Following a thorough assessment, the Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of Outright Monetary Transactions in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate. Coverage Outright Monetary Transactions will be considered for future cases of EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programmes or precautionary programmes as specified above. They may also be considered for Member States currently under a macroeconomic adjustment programme when they will be regaining bond market access. Transactions will be focused on the shorter part of the yield curve, and in particular on sovereign bonds with a maturity of between one and three years. No ex ante quantitative limits are set on the size of Outright Monetary Transactions. Creditor treatment The Eurosystem intends to clarify in the legal act concerning Outright Monetary Transactions that it accepts the same (pari passu) treatment as private or other creditors with respect to bonds issued by euro area countries and purchased by the Eurosystem through Outright Monetary Transactions, in accordance with the terms of such bonds. Sterilisation The liquidity created through Outright Monetary Transactions will be fully sterilised. Transparency Aggregate Outright Monetary Transaction holdings and their market values will be published on a weekly basis. Publication of the average duration of Outright Monetary Transaction holdings and the breakdown by country will take place on a monthly basis. Securities Markets Programme Following today’s decision on Outright Monetary Transactions, the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) is herewith terminated. The liquidity injected through the SMP will continue to be absorbed as in the past, and the existing securities in the SMP portfolio will be held to maturity.

"210","ECB takes further measures to increase collateral availability for counterparties","ECB takes further measures to increase collateral availability for counterparties 22 June 2012 On 20 June 2012 the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided on additional measures to improve the access of the banking sector to Eurosystem operations in order to further support the provision of credit to households and non-financial corporations. The Governing Council has reduced the rating threshold and amended the eligibility requirements for certain asset-backed securities (ABSs). It has thus broadened the scope of the measures to increase collateral availability which were introduced on 8 December 2011 and which remain applicable. In addition to the ABSs that are already eligible for use as collateral in Eurosystem operations, the Eurosystem will consider the following ABSs as eligible: Auto loan, leasing and consumer finance ABSs and ABSs backed by commercial mortgages (CMBSs) which have a second-best rating of at least “single A” [1] in the Eurosystem’s harmonised credit scale, at issuance and at all times subsequently. These ABSs will be subject to a valuation haircut of 16%. Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs), securities backed by loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), auto loan, leasing and consumer finance ABSs and CMBSs which have a second-best rating of at least “triple B” [2] in the Eurosystem’s harmonised credit scale, at issuance and at all times subsequently. RMBSs, securities backed by loans to SMEs, and auto loan, leasing and consumer finance ABSs would be subject to a valuation haircut of 26%, while CMBSs would be subject to a valuation haircut of 32%. The risk control framework with higher haircuts applicable to the newly eligible ABS aims at ensuring risk equalisation across asset classes and maintaining the risk profile of the Eurosystem. The newly eligible ABSs must also satisfy additional requirements which will be specified in the legal act to be adopted Thursday, 28 June 2012. The measures will take effect as soon as the relevant legal act enters into force. [1]A “single-A” rating is a rating of at least A3 from Moody’s, A- from Fitch or Standard & Poor’s, or AL from DBRS. [2]A “triple-B” rating is a rating of at least Baa3 from Moody’s, BBB- from Fitch or Standard & Poor’s, or BBB from DBRS.

This procedure will also remain in use for the Eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. Furthermore, the Governing Council has decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to be allotted on 25 July, 29 August, 26 September, 31 October, 28 November and 19 December 2012 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment.

"222","ECB announces measures to support bank lending and money market activity","ECB announces measures to support bank lending and money market activity 8 December 2011 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has today decided on additional enhanced credit support measures to support bank lending and liquidity in the euro area money market. In particular, the Governing Council has decided: To conduct two longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) with a maturity of 36 months and the option of early repayment after one year. To discontinue for the time being, as of the maintenance period starting on 14 December 2011, the fine-tuning operations carried out on the last day of each maintenance period. To reduce the reserve ratio, which is currently 2%, to 1% as of the reserve maintenance period starting on 18 January 2012. As a consequence of the full allotment policy applied in the ECB’s main refinancing operations and the way banks are using this option, the system of reserve requirements is not needed to the same extent as under normal circumstances to steer money market conditions. To increase collateral availability by (i) reducing the rating threshold for certain asset-backed securities (ABS) and (ii) allowing national central banks (NCBs), as a temporary solution, to accept as collateral additional performing credit claims (i.e. bank loans) that satisfy specific eligibility criteria. These two measures will take effect as soon as the relevant legal acts have been published. Modalities of the two longer-term refinancing operations with a maturity of 36 months and the option of early repayment after one year: The operations will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rate in these operations will be fixed at the average rate of the main refinancing operations over the life of the respective operation. Interest will be paid when the respective operation matures. After one year counterparties will have the option to repay any part of the amounts they are allotted in the operations, on any day that coincides with the settlement day of a main refinancing operation. Counterparties must inform their respective NCB, giving one week’s notice, of the amount they wish to repay. The operations will be conducted according to the schedule shown in the table. The first operation will be allotted on 21 December 2011 and will replace the 12-month LTRO announced on 6 October 2011. Announcement date Allotment date Settlement date First date for early repayment Maturity date Maturity 20 Dec. 2011 21 Dec. 2011 22 Dec. 2011 30 Jan. 2013 29 Jan. 2015 1134 days 28 Feb. 2012 29 Feb. 2012 1 Mar. 2012 27 Feb. 2013 26 Feb. 2015 1092 days Counterparties are permitted to shift all of the outstanding amounts received in the 12-month LTRO allotted in October 2011 into the first 3-year LTRO allotted on 21 December 2011. Those counterparties that wish to do so are requested to notify their respective NCB by Monday, 19 December 2011. Details of measures to increase collateral availability: In addition to the ABS that are already eligible for Eurosystem operations, ABS having a second-best rating of at least “single A” in the Eurosystem’s harmonised credit scale at issuance, and at all times subsequently, [1] and the underlying assets of which comprise residential mortgages and loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), will be eligible for use as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations. They must also satisfy all of the following requirements: (a) the cash-flow-generating assets backing the ABS must all belong to the same asset class, i.e. the asset class must consist of either only residential mortgages or only loans to SMEs; (b) the cash-flow-generating assets backing the ABS cannot include loans which are: at the time of issuance of the ABS, non-performing; or at any time, structured, syndicated or leveraged; (c) the counterparty submitting an ABS as collateral (or any third party with which it has close links) cannot act as an interest rate swap provider in relation to the ABS; (d) the ABS transaction documents must contain servicing continuity provisions; (e) the ABS must fulfil all other existing eligibility requirements, except for the ratings requirement. The NCBs are allowed, as a temporary solution, to accept as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations additional performing credit claims that satisfy specific eligibility criteria. The responsibility entailed in the acceptance of such credit claims will be borne by the NCB authorising their use. Details of the criteria for the use of credit claims will be announced in due course. Furthermore, the Governing Council would welcome wider use of credit claims as collateral in the Eurosystem’s credit operations on the basis of harmonised criteria and announces that the Eurosystem is aiming to: enhance its internal credit assessment capabilities; and encourage potential external credit assessment providers (rating agencies and providers of rating tools), and commercial banks that use an internal ratings-based system, to seek Eurosystem endorsement under the Eurosystem Credit Assessment Framework. [1]The second-best rating must comply with credit quality step 2 of the Eurosystem’s harmonised rating scale (details of which are available on the ECB’s website), which corresponds to a long-term rating of A+/A/A- by Fitch or Standard & Poor’s, A1/A2/A3 by Moody’s or AH/A/AL by DBRS.

"224","Coordinated central bank action  to address pressures in global money markets","Coordinated central bank action to address pressures in global money markets 30 November 2011 The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing coordinated actions to enhance their capacity to provide liquidity support to the global financial system. The purpose of these actions is to ease strains in financial markets and thereby mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses and so help foster economic activity. These central banks have agreed to lower the pricing on the existing temporary US dollar liquidity swap arrangements by 50 basis points so that the new rate will be the US dollar Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate plus 50 basis points. This pricing will be applied to all operations conducted from 5 December 2011. The authorisation of these swap arrangements has been extended to 1 February 2013. In addition, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank will continue to offer three-month tenders until further notice. As a contingency measure, these central banks have also agreed to establish temporary bilateral liquidity swap arrangements so that liquidity can be provided in each jurisdiction in any of their currencies should market conditions so warrant. At present, there is no need to offer liquidity in non-domestic currencies other than the US dollar, but the central banks judge it prudent to make the necessary arrangements so that liquidity support operations could be put into place quickly should the need arise. These swap lines are authorised through 1 February 2013. European Central Bank Decision The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided in co-operation with other central banks the establishment of a temporary network of reciprocal swap lines. This action will enable the Eurosystem to provide euro to those central banks when required, as well as enabling the Eurosystem to provide liquidity operations, should they be needed, in Japanese yen, sterling, Swiss francs and Canadian dollars (in addition to the existing operations in US dollars). The ECB will regularly conduct US dollar liquidity-providing operations with a maturity of approximately one week and three months at the new pricing. The schedule for these operations, which will take the form of repurchase operations against eligible collateral and will be carried out as fixed-rate tender procedures with full allotment, will be published today on the ECB’s website. In addition, the initial margin for three-month US dollar operations will be reduced from currently 20% to 12% and weekly updates of the EUR/USD exchange rate will be introduced in order to carry out margin calls. Those changes will be effective as of the operations to be conducted on 7 December 2011.

"225","ECB announces details of its new covered bond purchase programme (CBPP2)","ECB announces details of its new covered bond purchase programme (CBPP2) 3 November 2011 Further to its decision of 6 October 2011 to launch a new covered bond purchase programme (CBPP2), the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided today upon the technical modalities of the programme: The purchases of euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area, for an intended nominal amount of EUR 40 billion, will be distributed across the euro area and will be carried out by the Eurosystem by means of direct purchases. The purchases will be conducted in both the primary and the secondary markets. In order to be qualified for purchase under the programme, covered bonds must: - be eligible for use as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations; - comply with the criteria set out in Article 52(4) of the Directive on undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) or similar safeguards for non-UCITS-compliant covered bonds, as specified in Section 6.2.3 of the General Documentation; - have an issue volume of EUR 300 million or more; - have a minimum rating of BBB- or equivalent from at least one of the major rating agencies; - have a maximum residual maturity of 10.5 years; and - have underlying assets that include exposure to private and/or public entities. The counterparties qualified to participate in the CBPP2 are those counterparties that are eligible for the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations, together with any other counterparties that are used by the Eurosystem for the investment of its euro-denominated portfolios. The purchases will start in the course of November 2011 and are expected to be fully implemented by the end of October 2012 at the latest. Furthermore, the Governing Council has decided to make its CBPP2 portfolio available for lending. This decision will be implemented by the Eurosystem. Lending will be voluntary and conducted through security lending facilities offered by central securities depositories, or via matched repo transactions with eligible counterparties.

"227","ECB announces details of refinancing operations from October 2011 to 10 July 2012","ECB announces details of refinancing operations from October 2011 to 10 July 2012 6 October 2011 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has today decided to conduct two longer‑term refinancing operations (LTROs), one with a maturity of approximately 12 months, to be conducted in October 2011, and the other with a maturity of approximately 13 months, to be conducted in December 2011. The operations will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment in accordance with the calendar indicated below. In both operations, the rate applied will be fixed at the average of the rates in the main refinancing operations (MROs) over the life of the relevant LTRO, and interest will be paid when each operation matures. These operations will be conducted in addition to the regular and special-term refinancing operations, which will be unaffected. The Governing Council has also decided to continue conducting its MROs as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the sixth maintenance period of 2012 ends on 10 July 2012. This procedure will also remain in use for the Eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the sixth maintenance period (i.e. around the end of the second quarter) of 2012. The fixed rate in each special-term refinancing operation will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at that time. In addition, the Governing Council has decided to conduct the three-month LTROs due to be allotted on 25 January, 29 February, 28 March, 25 April, 30 May and 27 June 2012 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment.

"230","ECB publishes the 2011 Structural Issues Report on “Structural features of distributive trades and their impact on prices in the euro area”","ECB publishes the 2011 Structural Issues Report on “Structural features of distributive trades and their impact on prices in the euro area” 4 October 2011 The European Central Bank (ECB) is publishing its 2011 Structural Issues Report today. This year, it deals with “Structural features of distributive trades and their impact on prices in the euro area”. The aim of this year’s report is to analyse the structural features – particularly the degree of competition and regulatory aspects – of the distributive (i.e. wholesale and retail) trades sector and their impact on price developments in the euro area. Among the main findings of the report is that there remains a considerable degree of price dispersion across the euro area, with compelling evidence of a strong “border effect” on price differences across euro area countries. More generally, the report illustrates that structural features of the distributive trades sector affect prices in the euro area, in terms of price levels, the frequency of price changes, price dynamics and the pass-through of costs to prices. The report also finds that the distributive trades sector accounts for a noteworthy proportion of the worsening productivity differential between the euro area and the United States. Overall, the findings of the report suggest ample scope for further improving the Single Market. More specifically, further progress in improving effective competition in the distributive trades sector could help narrow price differentials and enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. A crucial step towards further progress would be the full implementation of the Services Directive. Structural reforms in the distributive trades sector could reduce profit mark-ups and give rise to substantial increases in output, employment and real wages. Furthermore, to unleash the full potential and benefits of online and cross-border trade, remaining regulatory and legislative barriers (such as consumer law, VAT-related issues, etc.) need to be addressed. The Structural Issues Report, which is an annual ECB publication, was transmitted by the ECB’s President, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, to Ms Sharon Bowles, Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament. Each year the report, which is prepared by a task force of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) under the aegis of the ECB’s Governing Council, identifies a topic on structural aspects of the euro area economy relevant for monetary policy. The report analyses this topic from a euro area and cross-country perspective, based on input from the staff of the ECB and of the ESCB national central banks. The full report is available on the ECB’s website.

"231","Results of the Euro Money Market Survey 2011","Results of the Euro Money Market Survey 2011 30 September 2011 Today the European Central Bank (ECB) is publishing the results of the “Euro Money Market Survey 2011”, which highlights the main developments in the euro money market in the second quarter of 2011, comparing them with the second quarter of 2010. The results of this year’s survey, which are derived from a constant panel of 105 banks (unless otherwise indicated; see the notes below), show the following. Aggregate turnover in the euro money market increased by 15%, after three years of declines. In the unsecured market, the cash borrowing of the banks on the panel increased by 26%, while their lending contracted by 5%. Total activity (i.e. lending and borrowing combined) was concentrated in maturities of one month or less. The secured market remained the largest segment, with aggregate turnover increasing for the second year in a row (rising by 10%). This increase was driven mainly by a 24% increase in activity for the overnight maturity. The percentage of secured market transactions that were cleared by central counterparties in the second quarter of 2010 was revised upwards to 51%. This share remained broadly stable at 50% in the second quarter of 2011. All derivative segments covered by the survey showed increases in turnover in the second quarter of 2011. In percentage terms, the most significant increases were observed in cross‑currency swaps (where turnover increased by 68%) and overnight index swaps (where turnover increased by 42%). Turnover for foreign exchange swaps increased only slightly (rising by 1%), after being the only derivative product that did not record a decline in the second quarter of 2010 relative to previous years. Notes This survey has been conducted on an annual basis since 1999 and always compares data for the second quarter of the current year with data for the second quarter of the previous year. It is conducted by experts from the European System of Central Banks – i.e. the ECB plus the national central banks of the European Union. The survey uses a constant panel of 105 banks wherever longer-term comparisons are made, but also includes data provided by the full panel of banks, which has grown over time, in order to obtain a more complete picture of the market. The full panel currently comprises 170 banks. The “Euro Money Market Survey 2011” can be downloaded from the ECB’s website, together with a summarised version of the survey data (CSV file).

"232","ECB publishes an updated version of the General Documentation","ECB publishes an updated version of the General Documentation 21 September 2011 The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published an updated consolidated version of “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures”. The version published today mainly includes changes on 3 aspects: First, the Eurosystem has abolished the eligibility requirement (Sections 6.2.1.5 and 6.2.1.6) that debt instruments issued by credit institutions, other than covered bank bonds, are only eligible if they are admitted to trading on a regulated market. At the same time, the Eurosystem risk control measures for marketable assets (Section 6.4.2) have been amended. Specifically, the Eurosystem has reduced the limit for the use of unsecured debt instruments issued by a credit institution or by any other entity with which the credit institution has close links. Such assets may only be used as collateral to the extent that the value assigned does not exceed 5% of the total value of collateral submitted (instead of 10%, as previously stipulated). Second, the introduction of a common minimum size threshold applicable to all eligible credit claims throughout the euro area has been postponed to 2013 (Section 6.2.2.1). Third, in order to stress the importance of counterparties’ compliance with existing national anti-money laundering/counter terrorist financing (AML/CTF) legislation, a provision has been introduced (Section 1.4) stating that all Eurosystem counterparties are deemed to be aware of, and must comply with, all obligations imposed on them by legislation regarding AML/CTF. The updated version of the “General Documentation” will apply from 1 January 2012 and can be found on the ECB’s website.

"242","ECB publishes the proceedings of the Sixth ECB Central Banking Conference","ECB publishes the proceedings of the Sixth ECB Central Banking Conference 3 June 2011 The European Central Bank (ECB) is today publishing the proceedings of the Sixth ECB Central Banking Conference, entitled “Approaches to monetary policy revisited – lessons from the crisis”, which was held on 18 and 19 November 2010. This volume contains a collection of papers, commentaries and speeches that review the strategic and operational decisions that central banks had taken to combat the crisis and that reflect on the lessons for the future. The contributions are grouped around five broad topics: monetary policy strategy, lessons from historical experiences, challenges for macroeconomic and finance theory, the international dimension of the crisis, and operational frameworks for monetary policy. The papers by Stephan Fahr, Roberto Motto, Massimo Rostagno, Frank Smets and Oreste Tristani and by Frederic Mishkin, as well as the comments by Guido Tabellini and William White discuss strategic questions. What is and what should be the role of money, credit and other financial indicators in monetary policy frameworks? What is the appropriate horizon for the inflation target? Should central banks manage risk and act pre-emptively? Should they lean against asset price bubbles? The speeches by Jean-Claude Trichet and Jürgen Stark provide a policy-maker’s perspective with regard to the strategy of the ECB. The second group of contributions, by Marc Flandreau, Carl-Ludwig Holtfrerich and Harold James, compares the current crisis with the 19th century banking crises and the Great Depression, drawing analogies and highlighting contrasts. The comment by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi contrasts some of their conclusions with recent data. The third group of contributions focuses on the following question: “what shortcomings in macroeconomic and finance theory has the crisis revealed, and how should they be addressed?” Jean-Philippe Bouchaud criticises economic models of asset prices and advocates the use of physics-based models of complex systems for modelling financial markets. Martin Eichenbaum responds to the post-crisis criticism of macroeconomic theory. John Geanakoplos argues that the analysis of leverage cycles should be a central element of macroeconomics and finance. The international dimension of the crisis is covered by the policy panel with contributions from Ben Bernanke, Henrique Meirelles, Dominique Strauss-Kahn and President Trichet – and is also reflected in Ben Bernanke’s keynote speech. Global imbalances endangering the current recovery are the common theme. Bernanke rejects the view that the United States can tackle its current account deficit on its own and links the imbalances with sustained foreign exchange interventions in some emerging market economies. The fifth group of contributions concentrates on monetary policy operations. In their paper, Nuno Cassola, Alain Durré and Cornelia Holthausen model the central bank’s trade-off between providing liquidity and sustaining private intermediation in the money market. The paper by Spence Hilton and James McAndrews explains the institutional and balance sheet constraints on the Federal Reserve System’s response to the crisis. The comments by Marvin Goodfriend and Rafael Repullo, among others, classify central bank operations into two groups, namely “monetary policy” and “credit policy”, and point out the fiscal implications of the latter.

Guideline ECB/2000/7 sets out the principles, instruments, procedures and criteria for the implementation of the single monetary policy in the euro area and contains two annexes: Annex I, entitled “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures”, (usually referred to as the “General Documentation”); Annex II, entitled “Additional minimum common features”, containing the features applicable to all contractual and regulatory arrangements for monetary policy operations. The amendments introduced by Guideline ECB/2010/30 concern Annex I (i.e. the General Documentation) and relate, in particular, to the following two aspects: Fixed-term deposits: the addition of fixed-term deposits from eligible counterparties with the Eurosystem to the list of assets eligible as collateral for Eurosystem operations. These fixed-term deposits will not be subject to any valuation haircut. Close links: the introduction of additional exemptions from the “close link prohibition” relating to non-UCITS-compliant covered bank bonds that (i) fulfil all criteria applicable to asset-backed securities, (ii) are backed by commercial mortgage loans, and (iii) are denominated in euro. The General Documentation has also been updated in light of Eesti Pank becoming a member of the Eurosystem and for the recent change of name of Ireland’s central bank. The new provision on fixed-term deposits will apply as of 1 January 2011 while the new provisions on the exemptions from the close link prohibition will apply as of 1 February 2011.

The Governing Council intends to introduce the loan-by-loan information requirements approximately within the next 18 months, first for residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs) and thereafter gradually for other ABSs. Loan-level data will be provided in accordance with the template which is available on the ECB’s website, at least on a quarterly basis on, or within one month of, the interest payment date of the instrument in question. To allow the processing, verification and transmission of the data, the Eurosystem will encourage market participants to establish the necessary data-handling infrastructure. This is expected to facilitate the application of the loan-by-loan information requirements and contribute to further developing transparency in the ABS market. When the necessary data-handling infrastructure has been established, the provision of loan-by-loan information will become an eligibility requirement for the instruments concerned. The Eurosystem will continue to accept securities not meeting the new information criteria until the obligation to submit loan-level data comes into force.

"259","Transitional provisions for the application of minimum reserve requirements in Estonia","Transitional provisions for the application of minimum reserve requirements in Estonia 27 October 2010 On 26 October 2010 the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) adopted a Decision on the application of minimum reserves by the ECB following the introduction of the euro in Estonia (ECB/2010/18). That introduction will take place on 1 January 2011. As of that date, credit institutions and branches of credit institutions (hereafter referred to as “institutions”) located in Estonia will be subject to the Eurosystem’s minimum reserve requirements. Given that the regular reserve maintenance period runs from 8 December 2010 to 18 January 2011, transitional provisions will be necessary to ensure that the relevant institutions are integrated smoothly into the Eurosystem’s minimum reserve system without placing a disproportionate burden on them. The Decision therefore provides for a transitional maintenance period from 1 to 18 January 2011 for the imposition of minimum reserve requirements on institutions located in Estonia. Furthermore, the Decision sets out specific rules governing the application of minimum reserve requirements during the transitional period and, in particular, describes the method of calculating the reserve base in relation to the transitional period for liabilities owed to institutions located in Estonia. In this respect, institutions located in other Member States whose currency is the euro may decide to deduct any liabilities owed to institutions located in Estonia from their reserve base for the maintenance periods from 8 December 2010 to 18 January 2011 and from 19 January to 8 February 2011. The Decision will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and will also be available on the ECB’s website (www.ecb.europa.eu).

"260","Book publication: “Enhancing monetary analysis”","Book publication: “Enhancing monetary analysis” 14 October 2010 The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published a book entitled “Enhancing monetary analysis”, edited by Lucas Papademos, former Vice-President of the ECB, and Jürgen Stark, member of the Executive Board of the ECB. The book summarises the results of a research agenda pursued by Eurosystem staff to enhance the set of tools used to conduct the ECB’s monetary analysis and describes how these results are used to support the preparation of monetary policy decisions. The book is in two main parts. The first part discusses the theoretical foundations of monetary analysis, explaining its prominent role in the ECB’s monetary policy strategy. It then describes how monetary analysis is conducted in practice at the ECB. The second part of the book summarises the main analytical results of recent Eurosystem research. The topics covered include: improved money demand models for the euro area; money-based indicator models for inflation; structural general equilibrium models with an active role for money and credit; the interrelationship between money and credit, on the one hand, and asset prices, on the other; and the scope for cross-checking the monetary analysis with the economic analysis using the flow-of-funds framework. The results of the research programme support continuity in the overall approach to monetary analysis adopted by the ECB since the introduction of the euro in 1999. At the same time, they underpin the evolution of the toolbox used to conduct monetary analysis as new tools are developed and existing tools refined in the light of methodological progress and newly available data. The publication of this book reflects the ECB’s desire to be transparent about the tools and models used to conduct monetary analysis in support of monetary policy decision-making. The book can be downloaded in electronic form from the ECB’s website. Hard copies are available from the ECB’s Press and Information Division at the address indicated below.

The Guideline sets out the principles, instruments, procedures and criteria for the implementation of the single monetary policy in the euro area, and contains two annexes: Annex 1, entitled “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” (usually referred to as the “General Documentation”); and Annex II, entitled “Additional minimum common features”, containing the features applicable to all contractual and regulatory arrangements for monetary policy operations. The amendments introduced by Guideline ECB/2010/13 concern primarily Annex I – i.e. the General Documentation – and relate, in particular, to the following four issues: Asset-backed securities (ABSs): clearer and more stringent provisions on the cash flow-generating assets backing ABSs, identifying swaps and synthetic securities as non-eligible cash flow-generating assets. In addition, in order to reduce claw-back risk with a view to limiting credit and legal risks, the amended provisions include restrictions on the geographical scope of ABS originators and the underlying assets to the European Economic Area (EEA), Close links: the introduction of additional exemptions from the prohibition of close links. It relates to non-UCITS covered bonds that fulfil all criteria that apply to asset-backed securities, and are both backed by residential real estate loans and denominated in euro. Discretionary measures: the enhancement of the formulation regarding the suspension, limitation or exclusion of counterparties and assets on the grounds of prudence or a default. Collateralisation non-compliance: consistency between the treatment of cases where the counterparty fails to sufficiently collateralise a liquidity-providing operation on the settlement day, and cases where the counterparty fails to sufficiently collateralise the operation during the life of the operation. The Guideline also introduces some editorial changes into Annex II. The new provisions will apply as from Sunday, 10 October 2010. Moreover, the amendments to the General Documentation also relate to changes introduced as a result of the biennial review of the risk control measures, announced on 28 July, which will apply as from 1 January 2011. The Governing Council amends Guideline ECB/2000/7 on a regular basis, in order to capture in a single legal act the relevant decisions on monetary policy instruments and procedures taken in the course of the previous months. The guidelines can be found on the ECB’s website. An updated version of the General Documentation will be published in January 2011, after all new provisions contained therein have come into force.

"266","ECB reviews risk control measures in its collateral framework","ECB reviews risk control measures in its collateral framework 28 July 2010 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has reviewed the risk control measures in the framework for assets eligible for use as collateral in Eurosystem market operations. The resulting changes stem from the biennial review of the Eurosystem risk control measures and the Governing Council’s decision of 8 April 2010 to introduce graduated valuation haircuts for lower-rated assets. The new schedule duly graduates haircuts according to differences in maturities, liquidity categories and the credit quality of the assets concerned, based on an updated assessment of risk characteristics of eligible assets and the actual use of eligible assets by counterparties. The new haircuts will not imply an undue decrease in the collateral available to counterparties. Moreover, the definition of liquidity categories for marketable assets and the application of additional valuation mark-downs for theoretically valued assets have been fine-tuned following the review. In particular, all non-Jumbo covered bonds, including structured covered bonds and multi-issuer covered bonds, together with traditional (UCITS-compliant) covered bonds, will be classified in liquidity category III. The additional valuation mark-down of 5% currently applied to theoretically valued asset-backed securities will be extended to theoretically valued bank bonds (including uncovered as well as covered bank bonds, namely Jumbos, traditional and structured covered bonds and multi-issuer covered bonds). The new haircut schedule, which will enter into force on 1 January 2011, is annexed to this press release. It contains the valuation haircuts applied to eligible marketable assets. A separate scheme will apply to inverse floating rate instruments and is also annexed to this press release, together with a new haircut schedule for non-marketable assets. The Governing Council recalls that, if required, the Eurosystem has the possibility to limit or exclude the use of certain assets as collateral in its credit operations, also at the level of individual counterparties.

The purchases of covered bonds started in July 2009. The aim of the programme has been to support a specific financial market segment that is important for the funding of banks and that had been particularly affected by the financial crisis. The purchases under the programme were to be for a nominal value of EUR 60 billion and they were expected to be fully implemented by 30 June 2010. Today, the CBPP has indeed been fully implemented. As announced last year the nominal amount of EUR 60 billion has been purchased on the primary and secondary markets. The Eurosystem central banks intend to keep the purchased covered bonds until maturity. More information on the CBPP will be provided in the regular Monthly Report which will be published on 8 July 2010.

"273","ECB decides on measures to address severe tensions in financial markets","ECB decides on measures to address severe tensions in financial markets 10 May 2010 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided on several measures to address the severe tensions in certain market segments which are hampering the monetary policy transmission mechanism and thereby the effective conduct of monetary policy oriented towards price stability in the medium term. The measures will not affect the stance of monetary policy. In view of the current exceptional circumstances prevailing in the market, the Governing Council decided: To conduct interventions in the euro area public and private debt securities markets (Securities Markets Programme) to ensure depth and liquidity in those market segments which are dysfunctional. The objective of this programme is to address the malfunctioning of securities markets and restore an appropriate monetary policy transmission mechanism. The scope of the interventions will be determined by the Governing Council. In making this decision we have taken note of the statement of the euro area governments that they “will take all measures needed to meet [their] fiscal targets this year and the years ahead in line with excessive deficit procedures” and of the precise additional commitments taken by some euro area governments to accelerate fiscal consolidation and ensure the sustainability of their public finances. In order to sterilise the impact of the above interventions, specific operations will be conducted to re-absorb the liquidity injected through the Securities Markets Programme. This will ensure that the monetary policy stance will not be affected. To adopt a fixed-rate tender procedure with full allotment in the regular 3-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to be allotted on 26 May and on 30 June 2010. To conduct a 6-month LTRO with full allotment on 12 May 2010, at a rate which will be fixed at the average minimum bid rate of the main refinancing operations (MROs) over the life of this operation. To reactivate, in coordination with other central banks, the temporary liquidity swap lines with the Federal Reserve, and resume US dollar liquidity-providing operations at terms of 7 and 84 days. These operations will take the form of repurchase operations against ECB-eligible collateral and will be carried out as fixed rate tenders with full allotment.

Having analysed the positive feedback received in the public consultation on the matter, the Governing Council decided that the ECB and the 16 national central banks of the euro area would proceed with the preparatory work for the establishment of loan-level information requirements. On 23 December 2009 the ECB launched a public consultation on the establishment of loan-by-loan information requirements for ABSs. The consultation ended on 26 February 2010 and over 50 responses were received from a broad range of market participants. The vast majority of respondents support the initiative, as it would increase transparency, contribute to more informed risk assessments and help to restore confidence in ABS markets. The preparatory work will begin immediately and should be completed by September 2010. It will address further the loan-level information requirements, as well as the technical implementation aspects covered by the public consultation. Subject to the approval of the Governing Council, market participants would have 12 months before the obligation to submit loan-level ABS information comes into force.

"278","ECB introduces graduated valuation haircuts  for lower-rated assets in its collateral framework  as of 1 January 2011","ECB introduces graduated valuation haircuts for lower-rated assets in its collateral framework as of 1 January 2011 8 April 2010 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to keep the minimum credit threshold for marketable and non‑marketable assets in the Eurosystem collateral framework at investment-grade level (i.e. BBB-/Baa3) beyond the end of 2010, except in the case of asset-backed securities (ABSs). In addition, the Governing Council has decided to apply, as of 1 January 2011, a schedule of graduated valuation haircuts to the assets rated in the BBB+ to BBB- range (or equivalent). [1] This graduated haircut schedule will replace the uniform haircut add-on of 5% that is currently applied to these assets. The detailed haircut schedule will be based on the following parameters: The new haircuts will be duly graduated according to differences across maturities, liquidity categories and the credit quality of the assets concerned. The lowest haircuts will apply to the most liquid assets with the shortest maturities, while the highest haircuts will apply to the least liquid assets with the longest maturities. The new haircuts will be at least as high as the haircut currently applied, which is a flat 5% add-on for the assets concerned over the haircut that would apply to similar assets with a higher credit quality. No changes will be made to the current haircut schedule foreseen for central government debt instruments and possible debt instruments issued by central banks that are rated in the above-mentioned range. The new haircuts will not imply an undue decrease in the collateral available to counterparties. The specific schedule of haircuts will be published in July 2010. Furthermore, the Governing Council confirmed that the following instruments will no longer be eligible as collateral as from 1 January 2011: marketable debt instruments denominated in currencies other than the euro, i.e. the US dollar, the pound sterling and the Japanese yen, and issued in the euro area; debt instruments issued by credit institutions, which are traded on the accepted non-regulated markets; and subordinated debt instruments when they are protected by an acceptable guarantee. [1]More precisely, the schedule applies to credit quality step 3 of the Eurosystem’s harmonised rating scale (available on the ECB’s website), in which the long-term rating of assets is BBB+/BBB/BBB- by Fitch or Standard & Poor’s, Baa1/Baa2/Baa3 by Moody’s or BBBH/BBB by DBRS.

"280","ECB announces details of refinancing operations with settlement up to 12 October 2010","ECB announces details of refinancing operations with settlement up to 12 October 2010 4 March 2010 In view of economic and financial market developments, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank has today decided to continue the gradual phasing-out of its non-standard operational measures. Specifically, the Governing Council has decided to continue conducting its main refinancing operations (MROs) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of this year’s ninth maintenance period on 12 October 2010. This tender procedure will also remain in use for the Governing Council’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed and at least until the ninth maintenance period of 2010. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the rate used in the respective MRO. The Governing Council has also decided to return to variable rate tender procedures in the regular 3-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs), starting with the operation to be allotted on 28 April 2010. Allotment amounts in these operations will be set with the aim of ensuring smooth conditions in money markets and avoiding any significant spreads between bid rates and the prevailing MRO rate. An indicative allotment amount will be pre-announced for each of the 3-month LTROs at the start of the maintenance period in which the operation is to be conducted. The MRO rate will be used as the minimum bid rate in the 3-month LTROs. This is a technical and transitional measure to avoid allotment rates below the prevailing MRO rate in the presence of ample liquidity. In order to smooth out the liquidity effect of the 12-month LTRO maturing on 1 July 2010, the Governing Council has decided to carry out an additional six-day fine-tuning operation with announcement, allotment and settlement on 1 July and maturity on 7 July, the latter date coinciding with the settlement day of the next MRO. The fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment will be used also in this operation, the fixed rate being the same as the prevailing MRO rate. Furthermore, the Governing Council has also decided, in line with its decision on the 12-month LTRO of 16 December 2009, to fix the rate in the 6-month LTRO to be allotted on 31 March 2010 at the average minimum bid rate of the MROs over the life of this operation(1). (1)Only one interest payment will be made. This interest payment will be made on the maturity date (30 September 2010) and be calculated as the allotted amount multiplied by Here, is the minimum bid rate of the MRO settled on 31 March 2010 and are the minimum bid rates of the 26 subsequent MROs. The operation will have a maturity of 182 days.

This volume contains a collection of papers, commentaries and speeches concerning the first decade of the euro and the recent global financial crisis. The first group of contributions summarises and evaluates developments during the first decade of the euro. Charles Wyplosz and Francesco Paolo Mongelli assess the evolution of major macroeconomic variables in the euro area between 1999 and 2008. Their analysis indicates that, in line with the ECB’s primary objective, inflation and inflation expectations in the euro area have been consistent with price stability, thereby supporting growth and employment, trade in goods and services as well as financial integration. Philip Lane, José Luis Peydró-Alcalde, Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, Simone Manganelli and Elias Papaioannou describe and evaluate the evolution of financial markets in the first decade of the euro, concluding that there was a substantial increase in the degree of financial integration in the euro area. They also discuss the effects of increased financial integration on financial developments, economic growth, international risk-sharing and current account developments in the euro area. This publication also reports the proceedings of two panels focusing on the tenth anniversary of the euro. A panel chaired by Francesco Giavazzi, comprising Erik Berglöf, Vítor Gaspar, Athanasios Orphanides and András Simor, discusses the past and future enlargement of the euro area, and a panel chaired by Wolfgang Schill, comprising Martin Feldstein, Andrew Rose, André Sapir and Jaume Ventura, considers the theory of optimal currency areas. The second group of contributions deals with the recent global financial crisis. Anil Kashyap, Raghuram Rajan and Jeremy Stein discuss the roots of the crisis and put forward a proposal for regulatory reform which aims to prevent crises from escalating in the future. A panel chaired by Lucrezia Reichlin, comprising Ben Bernanke, Stanley Fischer, Su Ning, Guillermo Ortiz and Jean-Claude Trichet, discusses international interdependency in the conduct of monetary policy, especially during the recent crisis. The tenth anniversary of the euro and the recent crisis are intertwined in the speeches delivered at the conference by members of the ECB’s Executive Board. The opening address by Lucas Papademos deals with certain early lessons drawn from the ongoing financial crisis. For example, the role of excessive credit growth and high leverage in identifying systemic risks; the desirability and feasibility of a policy of “leaning against the wind” of financial market excesses; and the importance of enhanced cooperation between central banks and supervisors in order to effectively safeguard financial stability. The keynote address by Jean-Claude Trichet focuses on a number of factors behind the financial market crisis, notably short-termism, lack of transparency in certain securities markets and excessive pro-cyclicality in the financial system, and suggests actions to significantly improve the resilience of the financial system. Finally, the closing address by Jürgen Stark emphasises the importance of the ECB’s robust institutional framework, including its independence from political influence and its monetary policy strategy for successfully achieving its mandate of maintaining price stability; it also reviews some of the forthcoming challenges, including a resolute implementation of necessary structural reforms to enhance the adjustment capacity of the euro area economy and the necessity of nominal and real convergence for a smooth functioning of an enlarged euro area. The text of each address is included in this volume. Printed copies of this publication can be obtained free of charge from the ECB’s Press and Information Division.

"287","ECB announces details of refinancing operations up to 7 April 2010","ECB announces details of refinancing operations up to 7 April 2010 3 December 2009 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has today decided to continue conducting its main refinancing operations (MROs) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as is needed - and at least until the third maintenance period of 2010 ends on 13 April. This tender procedure will also continue to be used in the special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue for at least the first three maintenance periods of 2010. The Governing Council has also decided that the rate in the last 12-month longer-term refinancing operation, to be allotted on 16 December 2009, will be fixed at the average minimum bid rate of the MROs over the life of this operation (1). As regards longer-term refinancing operations in the first quarter of 2010, the Governing Council has decided to carry out the last six-month longer-term refinancing operation on 31 March 2010. This operation will be carried out using a full allotment fixed rate tender procedure, as will the regular monthly three-month longer-term refinancing operations already announced for the first quarter of 2010 (see the ECB’s press release of 29 May 2009). Looking beyond the first quarter of 2010, the Governing Council will take into account the need to smooth out the liquidity effect of the 12-month longer-term refinancing operations maturing during the second half of 2010. (1) Only one interest payment will be made - on the maturity date (i.e. 23 December 2010). This interest payment will be calculated as the allotted amount multiplied by Here, R0MBR is the minimum bid rate of the MRO settled on 16 December 2009, while RtMBR, t=1,…,53 are the minimum bid rates of the 53 subsequent MROs. The operation will have a maturity of 371 days.

"289","ECB amends rating requirements for asset-backed securities in Eurosystem credit operations","ECB amends rating requirements for asset-backed securities in Eurosystem credit operations 20 November 2009 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to amend the rating requirements for asset-backed securities (ABSs) to be eligible for use in Eurosystem credit operations. The Eurosystem will require at least two ratings from an accepted external credit assessment institution for all ABSs issued as of 1 March 2010. In determining the eligibility of these ABSs, the Eurosystem will apply the “second-best” rule, meaning that not only the best, but also the second-best available rating must comply with the minimum threshold applicable to ABSs (see the press release of 20 January 2009). As of 1 March 2011, the second-best rule and the requirement to have at least two ratings will be applied to all ABSs, regardless of their date of issue. The Governing Council has deemed it necessary to introduce the above amendments to ensure that the Eurosystem’s requirement of high credit standards for all eligible collateral is met. In addition, the changes, which reflect recent market developments, aim to make a further contribution to restoring the proper functioning of the ABS market. The list of external credit assessment institutions accepted by the Eurosystem is available on the ECB’s website.

These modalities are as follows: The purchases, for an amount of EUR 60 billion, will be distributed across the euro area and will be carried out by means of direct purchases. The purchases will be conducted in both the primary and the secondary markets. In order to be eligible for purchase under the programme, covered bonds must: be eligible for use as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations; comply with the criteria set out in Article 22(4) of the Directive on undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) or similar safeguards for non-UCITS-compliant covered bonds; have, as a rule, an issue volume of about EUR 500 million or more and, in any case, not lower than EUR 100 million; have, as a rule, been given a minimum rating of AA or equivalent by at least one of the major rating agencies (Fitch, Moody’s, S&P or DBRS) and, in any case, not lower than BBB-/Baa3; and have underlying assets that include exposure to private and/or public entities. The counterparties eligible to the purchase programme are those eligible for the Eurosystem’s credit operations, as well as euro area-based counterparties used by the Eurosystem for the investment of its euro denominated portfolios.

The operations will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment, and the rate in the first of these operations will be the rate in the main refinancing operations at that time. In subsequent longer-term refinancing operations with full allotment, the fixed rate may include a spread in addition to the rate in the main refinancing operations, depending on the circumstances at the time. The operations will be conducted in addition to the regular and supplementary longer-term refinancing operations, which will be unaffected. A tentative schedule for such longer-term refinancing operations in 2009 is provided below.

"305","EIB becomes an eligible counterparty in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations","EIB becomes an eligible counterparty in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations 7 May 2009 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has today decided that the European Investment Bank (EIB) will become an eligible counterparty in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations on 8 July 2009. As of this date, the EIB will have access, if and when appropriate for its treasury management, to the Eurosystem’s open market operations and standing facilities through the Banque centrale du Luxembourg under the same conditions as any other counterparty. The EIB will comply with all eligibility requirements and it will hold minimum reserves with the Eurosystem. Access to the Eurosystem’s liquidity is a natural complement to the EIB’s financing initiatives and will facilitate the accommodation by the EIB of additional demand for its lending programme. At present, this additional demand is estimated to be €10 billion in 2009. Given the usual leverage ratios involved, it is estimated by the EIB that such additional financing could generate additional investment value up to €40 billion this year. More information on the EIB’s activities can be found in the statement issued by the EIB today.

At the same time the Governing Council adopted the respective ECB Guideline on temporary changes to the rules relating to eligibility of collateral (ECB/2008/18), which will enter into force on 1 December 2008 and apply until 31 December 2009. This Guideline replaces the ECB Regulation of 23 October 2008 (ECB/2008/11), which will expire on 30 November 2008. Any syndicated loans governed by the laws of England and Wales that have been mobilised by counterparties as collateral under the current implementing ECB Decision (ECB/2008/15), which will also expire on 30 November 2008, shall remain eligible until the maturity of the relevant collateralised transaction.

"317","Further technical specifications for the temporary expansion of the collateral framework","Further technical specifications for the temporary expansion of the collateral framework 17 November 2008 With reference to the measures announced by the European Central Bank (ECB) on 15 October 2008, i.e. the temporary expansion of the list of assets eligible as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations, the Eurosystem provides further technical specifications on the enlarged eligibility criteria which will remain in force until the end of 2009. As of 17 November 2008, the Eurosystem will accept as collateral in its credit operations euro-denominated syndicated credit claims, governed by the law of England and Wales (English law), subject to the conditions and procedures, as described below and set out in detail in the Decision of the European Central Bank of 14 November on the implementation of Regulation ECB/2008/11 of 23 October 2008 on temporary changes to the rules relating to eligibility of collateral (ECB/2008/15), which will be published on the ECB website and the Official Journal. For syndicated loans under English law, the total number of different governing laws that are applicable to (i) the counterparty, (ii) the creditor, (iii) the debtor, (iv) the guarantor (if relevant), (v) the credit claim agreement and (vi) the mobilisation agreement shall not exceed three. To take account of prevailing market practices, such borrowing activities conducted by a non-financial corporation through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) are considered eligible provided that this non-financial corporation has fully guaranteed the SPV, and that the guarantee complies with the requirements set out in Chapters 6.2.2 and 6.3.3 of the General Documentation. To contain the credit risk that is related to the facility agent in the syndicate, responsible for the collection and distribution of payments, the facility agent must have a minimum long-term rating of ‘A-’ by Fitch or Standard & Poor’s, ‘A3’ by Moody’s or ‘AL’ by Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS). Syndicated loans will be considered to be denominated in euro provided that the relevant loan agreement does not allow the debtor or the debtor’s agent, on its behalf, to vary from the denomination of euro at any time before the maturity of the relevant Eurosystem credit operation. Eurosystem national central banks (NCBs) will mobilise syndicated loans governed by English law directly from the relevant counterparty in accordance with their respective domestic procedures for credit claims. The mobilisation agreement will be governed by the law of a Member State belonging to the euro area. To ensure the validity of mobilisation under English law, the counterparty will be required to notify the debtor under a syndicated loan agreement of the mobilisation of such syndicated loan as collateral before or immediately following mobilisation of the loan. Counterparties will also be required to provide the relevant NCB with a copy of the confirmation received from the Registrar of Companies of England and Wales that mobilisation of the syndicated loan has been registered at Companies House. Further legal requirements, most notably relating to the transferability of the loan, but also relating to a) set off issues, b) restrictions on the realisation of the loan, c) the consequences of the replacement of a lender, d) the disclosure of confidential information regarding the debtor and e) taxation and indemnity matters are specified in the Decision of the European Central Bank of 14 November on the implementation of Regulation ECB/2008/11 of 23 October 2008 on temporary changes to the rules relating to eligibility of collateral (ECB/2008/15). To confirm compliance with all these requirements, counterparties will be required, before mobilisation, to deliver to the relevant NCB an opinion of UK (and other appropriate) tax counsel and a diligence letter from external legal counsel addressing a number of due diligence matters in a manner and form satisfactory to the Eurosystem. This diligence letter, which may be further elaborated by the ECB from time to time, is published on the ECB website. For the time being, Correspondent Central Banking Model (CCBM) procedures for the cross-border use of credit claims (as reflected in chapter 6.6 of the General Documentation) shall not apply to the mobilisation of syndicated loans. Syndicated loans mobilised with one NCB cannot be used on a cross-border level to collateralise credit provided by other NCBs through branches and subsidiaries located in other countries. The Eurosystem may consider whether a further variant to the CCBM to deal with the cross-border use of this type of collateral could be implemented in the short-term, should the business cases for it arise. Counterparties are invited to contact their respective national central banks (home central bank) on further operational and legal implementation aspects.

As of 14 November 2008, marketable debt instruments denominated in some currencies other than the euro, namely the US dollar, pound sterling or Japanese yen, are eligible collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, provided that they are issued and held/settled in the euro area, and the issuer is established in the European Economic Area (EEA). Furthermore, they should fulfil all other eligibility criteria, as temporarily amended in earlier decisions of the ECB. It is recalled that international debt securities in global bearer form issued after 1 January 2007 through the ICSDs Euroclear Bank (Belgium) and Clearstream Banking Luxembourg must, in order to be eligible, be issued in the form of New Global Notes (NGNs) and must be deposited with a Common Safekeeper (CSK) which is an ICSD or, if applicable, a CSD that fulfils the minimum standards established by the ECB. The exchange rate to be applied between the foreign currencies and the euro will be the euro foreign exchange reference rates, updated on a daily basis, as published on the ECB’s website on the day before the valuation. Marketable debt instruments denominated in other currencies than the euro will be subject to a uniform haircut add-on of 8%. The application of haircut add‑ons will be cumulative. For example, a marketable debt instrument denominated in a foreign currency and rated below A- will be subject to a total haircut add-on of 13% (8% due to the denomination in a foreign currency and 5% due to the rating below A-). Finally, for assets used on a cross-border basis, the home central banks will not accept marketable debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies with an income flow (e.g. a coupon payment) occurrence or falling due in the period for which they are put forward to be used as collateral with the Eurosystem. Subject to a positive eligibility assessment, marketable debt instruments denominated in the foreign currencies set out above will be included in the list of eligible marketable assets published and updated on a daily basis on the ECB’s website. It is the intention of the Eurosystem to include the new eligible assets mentioned above in the list of marketable assets for the first time during the regular update of the list on 13 November 2008 at 6.30 p.m. CET. Further specifications on the implementation and the legal aspects related to the acceptance of euro‑denominated syndicated loans under the law of England will be published in due course.

"320","ECB hosts meeting on establishing central counterparties for credit default swaps","ECB hosts meeting on establishing central counterparties for credit default swaps 3 November 2008 The European Central Bank (ECB) today hosted a meeting with European stakeholders concerning the establishment of central counterparties (CCPs) for credit default swaps. Participants included the potential providers of such CCPs, their regulators and the main users (dealers and buy-side). The meeting complemented initiatives by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the European Commission in this field. The Eurosystem shares the views of the Financial Stability Forum and of the European Commission on the importance of reducing counterparty risk and of enhancing transparency in OTC derivatives markets, especially in those parts of the market that are of systemic importance (e.g. credit derivatives, including credit default swaps). There are a number of initiatives aiming to achieve these goals through the introduction of centralised clearing solutions for OTC derivatives. The Eurosystem sees the introduction of CCPs for OTC derivatives as an appropriate solution to tackle the aforementioned issues because CCPs, by virtue of concentrating outstanding positions in one place, (i) reduce the counterparty risk to which market participants are exposed; (ii) increase market integrity, transparency and the availability of information; (iii) standardise the criteria for evaluation of exposures; and (iv) free up collateral. Participants at the meeting underlined the merits of multiple solutions in general and of at least one European solution. The Eurosystem stands ready, in cooperation with the other authorities, to facilitate the effective collective action of the private sector in this regard.

"322","Changes to the framework for implementation of monetary policy in the euro area","Changes to the framework for implementation of monetary policy in the euro area 23 October 2008 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today adopted Guideline on monetary policy instruments and procedures of the Eurosystem (ECB/2008/13), amending the Guideline ECB/2000/7. The amendments pertain to: Annex I of the Guideline, entitled “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” (referred to as the “General Documentation”), and Annex II of the Guideline, setting out the “additional minimum common features”. The amendments relate, in particular, to the following two topics: Risk control measures: The refinements to the risk control framework already announced on 4 September 2008, which will enter into force on 1 February 2009, will be reflected in the General Documentation. Minimum reserve requirements: The General Documentation will be updated in line with the changes to Regulation ECB/2003/9 of 12 September 2003 on the application of minimum reserves, approved by written procedure by the Governing Council on 22 October 2008. These changes primarily aim at clarifying the criteria for granting exemptions from reserve requirements. The amendments to Annexes I and II of Guideline ECB/2000/7 relating to the above items will apply from 1 February 2009. The Governing Council amends Guideline ECB/2000/7 on an annual basis, in order to capture in a single legal act the relevant decisions on monetary policy instruments and procedures taken in the course of the previous 12 months. Moreover, the measures which have been decided by the Governing Council on 15 October 2008 to further expand the collateral framework and enhance the provision of liquidity, are being implemented via Regulation of the European Central Bank on temporary changes to the rules relating to eligibility of collateral (ECB/2008/11), adopted by the Governing Council today. The Regulation will have immediate effect and apply for a limited period of time. It will be eventually replaced by Guideline of the European Central Bank on temporary changes to the rules relating to eligibility of collateral (ECB/2008/12), adopted also today by the Governing Council, the provisions of which are identical and which will enter into force upon completion of the adaptation of the monetary policy documentation by all Eurosystem members and apply until 31 December 2009. The above-mentioned legal acts can be obtained via the ECB’s website www.ecb.europa.eu. The updated version of the General Documentation will be published via the ECB’s website at a later stage.

"323","Technical specifications for the temporary expansion of the collateral framework","Technical specifications for the temporary expansion of the collateral framework 17 October 2008 With reference to the measures announced by the European Central Bank (ECB) on 15 October 2008 [1], i.e. the expansion of the list of assets eligible as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations, the Eurosystem provides a first batch of further technical specifications on the enlarged eligibility criteria which will remain in force until the end of 2009. As of 22 October 2008, the credit threshold for marketable and non-marketable assets is lowered from “A-“ to “BBB-“, with the exception of asset-backed securities (ABS), for which the credit quality threshold of “A-“ remains into force. This implies that the Eurosystem accepts instruments that have a rating that is included in the credit quality step 3 of the Eurosystem harmonised rating scale [2]. The Eurosystem considers a probability of default (PD) over a one-year horizon of 0.40% as equivalent to the “BBB-“ credit assessment. A haircut add-on of 5% will be applied to all assets rated below “A-“. In addition, as of 22 October 2008, the Eurosystem will accept the following additional marketable assets as collateral in its credit operations: Debt instruments issued by credit institutions, including certificates of deposits, which are traded on certain non-regulated markets as specified by the ECB [3] and which fulfil all other eligibility criteria. These instruments will be subject to a 5% haircut add-on. Subordinated marketable debt instruments, which are protected by an acceptable guarantee as specified in section 6.3.2 of the General Documentation and which fulfil all other eligibility criteria. These instruments will be subject to a haircut add-on of 10% and to a further 5% valuation markdown in case of theoretical valuation. Subject to positive eligibility assessment, debt instruments issued by credit institutions which are traded on non-regulated markets, subordinated marketable debt instruments as well as the marketable assets meeting the new credit threshold will be included in the list of eligible marketable assets published and updated on a daily basis on the ECB’s website. It is the intention of the Eurosystem to include the new eligible assets mentioned above in the list of marketable assets for the first time during the regular update of the list on 21 of October 2008 at 6.30 p.m. CET. The Eurosystem will at a later stage, but as soon as possible, address in more detail technical specifications for marketable debt instruments issued in the euro area and denominated in certain foreign currencies, namely the US dollar, the British pound or the Japanese yen, as well as euro-denominated syndicated credit claims governed by UK law. Counterparties are invited to contact their respective national central banks on further operational implementation aspects.

"324","Swiss National Bank and European Central Bank cooperation to provide Swiss franc liquidity","Swiss National Bank and European Central Bank cooperation to provide Swiss franc liquidity 15 October 2008 The increased tensions in international money markets have also led to upward pressure on short-term Swiss Franc money market rates. At the same time, Swiss franc funding needs of banks with no direct access to Swiss National Bank operations have increased, notably in the euro area. Therefore, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and the European Central Bank (ECB) are jointly announcing measures to improve liquidity in short-term Swiss franc money markets. Each Monday, starting on 20 October 2008, the Eurosystem and the SNB will conduct EUR/CHF foreign exchange swaps providing Swiss francs against euro with a term of 7 days at a fixed price. The fixed price and the maximum amounts allotted by ECB and SNB will be announced before the operation. If the aggregate amount of bids exceeds the maximum amounts, the allocation is carried out on a pro rata basis. The ECB and SNB have entered into a temporary swap arrangement through which the ECB can access Swiss franc liquidity to provide the Swiss franc funding that is allotted to banks in its jurisdiction. This measure will be in place as long as needed, at least until January 2009. The foreign exchange swap transaction is conducted as follows: the Eurosystem and the SNB will buy EUR against CHF in the near leg of the transaction and will simultaneously sell EUR against CHF in the far leg. The price, i.e., the swap points, will be calculated by using the rate applied in main refinancing operations of the ECB (currently 3.75%) and the SNB 1-week repo rate plus 25 basis points. This corresponds to an interest rate for the additional Swiss franc funding of 25 basis points above the SNB's 1-week repo rate. Further information about the EUR/CHF foreign exchange swaps of the ECB and the SNB is provided in separate instruction sheets available on the respective websites: http://www.ecb.europa.eu; http://www.snb.ch.

"325","Measures to further expand the collateral framework and enhance the provision of liquidity","Measures to further expand the collateral framework and enhance the provision of liquidity 15 October 2008 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided, by means of a teleconference, on the following measures: The list of assets eligible as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations will be expanded as set out below, with this expansion remaining into force until the end of 2009. As from the operation settling on 30 October 2008 and until the end of the first quarter in 2009, the provision of longer-term refinancing by the Eurosystem will be enhanced as set out below. The Eurosystem will start offering US dollar liquidity also through foreign exchange swaps. Expansion of the list of assets eligible as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations The Eurosystem will add the following instruments to the list of assets eligible as collateral in its credit operations: Marketable debt instruments denominated in other currencies than the euro, namely the US dollar, the British pound and the Japanese yen, and issued in the euro area. These instruments will be subject to a uniform haircut add-on of 8%. Euro-denominated syndicated credit claims governed by UK law. Debt instruments issued by credit institutions, which are traded on the accepted non-regulated markets that are mentioned on the ECB website; this measure implies inter alia that certificates of deposits (CDs) will also be eligible when traded on one of these accepted non-regulated markets. All debt instruments issued by credit institutions, which are traded on the accepted non-regulated markets, will be subject to a 5% haircut add-on. Subordinated debt instruments when they are protected by an acceptable guarantee as specified in section 6.3.2 of the General Documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures. These instruments will be subject to a haircut add-on of 10%, with a further 5% valuation markdown in case of theoretical valuation. Furthermore, the Eurosystem will lower the credit threshold for marketable and non-marketable assets from A- to BBB-, with the exception of asset-backed securities (ABS), and impose a haircut add-on of 5% on all assets rated BBB-. The date of entry into effect as well as further technical details on these measures will be communicated as soon as possible. The measures will remain in force until the end of 2009. The expansion of the eligibility criteria announced today will be combined with vigilant monitoring of the use of the framework. Moreover, as of 20 October 2008 and at least until the end of the first maintenance period in 2009 on 20 January, fixed term deposits held with the Eurosystem will be eligible collateral for Eurosystem credit operations. Enhancement of the provision of longer-term refinancing Consistently with the temporary expansion of the collateral pool, the Eurosystem will also enhance its provision of longer-term refinancing as follows: All longer-term refinancing operations will, until March 2009, be carried out through a fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment. The two 3-month supplementary longer-term refinancing operations (SLTRO) maturing in February and in March 2009 will be rolled-over and an additional 3-month operation will be conducted in January 2009. The outstanding 6-month SLTRO maturing in January 2009 will be rolled-over, and four additional 6-month SLTROs will be carried out in November 2008, December 2008, February 2009 and March 2009 in parallel with the respective 3-month SLTROs. As result, two 3-month LTROs/SLTROs and one 6-month LTRO will be carried out each month until and including March 2009. Moreover, the special term refinancing operation (STRO) allotted on 29 September 2008 will be rolled-over when it matures on 7 November 2008 and it will have a maturity matching the length of the reserve maintenance period; A schedule of the above operations is provided in the table below. The ECB will continue to steer liquidity towards balanced conditions in a way which is consistent with the objective to keep short-term rates close to the interest rate on the main refinancing operation.. For that purpose it will also accept fixed term deposits with a one week maturity.

The BoE, ECB and SNB will conduct tenders of U.S. dollar funding at 7-day, 28-day and 84-day maturities at fixed interest rates for full allotment. Funds will be provided at a fixed rate, set in advance of each operation. Counterparties in these operations will be able to borrow any amount they wish against the appropriate collateral in each jurisdiction. Accordingly, sizes of the reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) between the Federal Reserve and the BoE, the ECB, and the SNB will be increased to accommodate whatever quantity of US dollar funding is demanded. The Bank of Japan will be considering the introduction of similar measures. Central banks will continue to work together and are prepared to take whatever measures are necessary to provide sufficient liquidity in short-term funding markets. ECB decisions Starting on 15 October the Eurosystem will, every Wednesday, conduct a liquidity providing US dollar operation with a term of 7 days. All future auctions with a term of 7 days, 28 days and 84 days will be conducted at a fixed rate with full allotment. The 28-day and 84-day US dollar operations will be conducted according to the schedule released on 7 October 2008. As of Thursday 16 October, daily US dollar overnight operations will be conducted only if necessary in view of market developments.

As of 9 October, the ECB will reduce the corridor of standing facilities from 200 basis points to 100 basis points around the interest rate on the main refinancing operation. Therefore, as of 9 October, the rate of the marginal lending facility will be reduced from 100 to 50 basis points above the interest rate on the main refinancing operation, i.e. currently to 4.25%, and the rate of the deposit facility will be increased from 100 to 50 basis points below the interest rate on the main refinancing operation, i.e. currently to 3.25%.

"328","Monetary policy decisions","Monetary policy decisions 8 October 2008 Throughout the current financial crisis, central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets. Inflationary pressures have started to moderate in a number of countries, partly reflecting a marked decline in energy and other commodity prices. Inflation expectations are diminishing and remain anchored to price stability. The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability. Some easing of global monetary conditions is therefore warranted. Accordingly, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Federal Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing reductions in policy interest rates. The Bank of Japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions. The Governing Council of the ECB, by means of teleconferencing, has taken the following monetary policy decisions: The minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be reduced by 50 basis points to 3.75 %, with effect from the main refinancing operation to be settled on 15 October 2008. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be reduced by 50 basis points to 4.75 %, with immediate effect. The interest rate on the deposit facility will be reduced by 50 basis points to 2.75 %, with immediate effect. In the euro area, upside inflationary risks have recently decreased further. It remains imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting. Keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with our objective and securing price stability in the medium term will support sustainable growth and employment and contribute to financial stability.

"335","Biennial review of the risk control measures in Eurosystem credit operations","Biennial review of the risk control measures in Eurosystem credit operations 4 September 2008 Every two years the ECB conducts a review of the risk control measures for Eurosystem credit operations. These risk control measures are applied to the assets deposited by the Eurosystem’s counterparties as collateral for the credit the Eurosystem gives through its open market operations and the marginal lending facility, as well as in the form of intra-day credit for payment systems purposes (see Section 6.4 of “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area – General Documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures”, commonly referred to as the “General Documentation” [1]). The Eurosystem’s collateral framework has proven robust and efficient over the years, and during the recent episode of financial market turbulence. In particular, the acceptance of a wide range of collateral contributes to the resilience of euro area financial markets. While fully preserving this feature, following its biennial review the ECB has incorporated some technical refinements in its risk control framework for Eurosystem credit operations. These technical refinements, which are set out below, reflect, inter alia, improvements in the methodological framework, the assessment of market and liquidity risk characteristics of eligible assets, the actual use of eligible assets by counterparties and new developments in financial instruments. (1) With regard to the risk control measures applied to marketable assets, a new liquidity category for marketable assets will be introduced (see Table 6 of the “General Documentation”). This new category IV will be composed of credit institution debt instruments (other than Jumbo and traditional covered bank bonds) that were previously part of category III. Old category IV will be renamed category V. The valuation haircuts applied to eligible marketable assets in the different liquidity categories will be as follows: Levels of valuation haircuts applied to eligible marketable assets in relation to fixed coupon and zero coupon instruments (percentages) Liquidity categories Category I Category II Category III Category IV Category V Residualmaturity(years) Fixed coupon Zero coupon Fixed coupon Zero coupon Fixed coupon Zero coupon Fixed coupon Zero coupon Fixed or zero coupon 0-1 0.5 0.5 1 1 1.5 1.5 6.5 6.5 12* 1-3 1.5 1.5 2.5 2.5 3 3 8 8 3-5 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 9.5 10 5-7 3 3.5 4.5 5 5.5 6 10.5 11 7-10 4 4.5 5.5 6.5 6.5 8 11.5 13 >10 5.5 8.5 7.5 12 9 15 14 20 * Assets in this liquidity category that are given a theoretical value (in accordance with Section 6.5 of the “General Documentation”) will be subject to an additional valuation markdown of 5%. As can be seen from the table above, assets in new liquidity category V (former liquidity category IV) will be subject to a haircut of 12% regardless of their residual maturity and coupon structure. This corresponds to the level of haircuts that was previously assigned to assets in this liquidity category with a fixed coupon and a residual maturity of over ten years. Furthermore, assets in this liquidity category that are given a theoretical value (in accordance with Section 6.5 of the “General Documentation”) will be subject to an additional valuation haircut. This haircut will be applied directly to the theoretical value of the asset in the form of a valuation markdown of 5%, which corresponds to an additional haircut of 4.4%. (2) The definition of “close links”, as given in Section 6.2.3 of the “General Documentation”, will be extended to include situations in which a counterparty submits an asset-backed security as collateral when it (or any third party that has close links to it) provides support to that asset-backed security by entering into a currency hedge with the issuer or guarantor of the asset-backed security or by providing liquidity support of more than 20% of the nominal value of the asset-backed security. (3) With regard to the Eurosystem Credit Assessment Framework (see Section 6.3 of the “General Documentation”), for an asset to be eligible as collateral, the related credit assessment issued by an eligible external credit assessment institution (ECAI) must be based on a public rating. In the case of asset-backed securities, ratings must be explained in a publicly available credit-rating report (either a detailed pre-sale report or a new issue report). This report must include a comprehensive analysis of the structural and legal aspects, a detailed collateral pool analysis, an analysis of the transaction participants and any other relevant particularities of the transaction. Moreover, ECAIs must publish rating reviews for asset-backed securities at least on a quarterly basis. These reviews should necessarily contain an update of the key transaction data (e.g. composition of the collateral pool, transaction participants and capital structure) and performance data. Finally, it is recalled that the Eurosystem has the possibility to limit or exclude the use of certain assets as collateral for its credit operations, also at the level of individual counterparties, if required, to ensure adequate risk protection of the Eurosystem in line with Article 18.1 of the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank. All the above-mentioned changes to the risk control framework for Eurosystem credit operations will enter into force on 1 February 2009 and will be reflected in the forthcoming update of the “General Documentation”.

"339","Measures to enhance the US dollar term auction facility","Measures to enhance the US dollar term auction facility 30 July 2008 The European Central Bank (ECB), the Federal Reserve and the Swiss National Bank are announcing an enhancement of their US dollar liquidity providing operations. ECB decisions The Governing Council of the ECB has decided, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve, to establish a cycle of 84-day Term Auction Facility operations. Starting on 8 August, the ECB will conduct 84-day operations under the Term Auction Facility, while continuing to conduct operations with a maturity of 28-days. The ECB will conduct bi-weekly operations, alternating between operations of USD 20 billion of 28-days maturity and operations of USD 10 billion of 84-days maturity. This means that, following a transition period, there will be three outstanding 84-day operations and one outstanding 28-day operation for a total unchanged outstanding amount of USD 50 billion. During this transition period in August and September, the ECB will reduce the amount of 28-day operations along with the introduction of 84-day operations. Also during the transition phase the overall amount of outstanding US dollar liqudity providing operations in the context of the Term Auction Facility will remain at USD 50 billion, with the exception of a temporary increase to USD 55 billion in the first operation of the transition phase. A document setting out the operational procedures will be made available on the ECB’s website. The operational details of each auction will continue to be announced in due time before each tender on the ECB’s wire services pages and on the ECB’s web site. It is intended to continue the provision of USD liquidity for as long as the Governing Council considers it to be needed in view of the prevailing market conditions.

This edition looks back at the ECB’s work and achievements over the past ten years. It also considers the challenges that the ECB and the euro area face as they enter their second decade. In the Foreword to this Monthly Bulletin, Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, says: “For nearly ten years, price stability has been broadly achieved despite the fact that strong global commodity price increases – on which monetary policy has no direct influence – have affected Europe and the rest of the world, leading to an average inflation rate that has been slightly above 2% since the launch of the euro. Stable prices are essential.” Jürgen Stark, member of the ECB’s Executive Board, chaired the editorial committee which produced this edition of the Monthly Bulletin.

"344","Joint communiqué on the Slovak koruna","Joint communiqué on the Slovak koruna 28 May 2008 At the request of the Slovak authorities, the ministers of the euro-area Member States of the European Community, the European Central Bank and the ministers and the central bank governors of Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovakia have decided, by mutual agreement, following a common procedure involving the European Commission and after consultation of the Economic and Financial Committee, to adapt the central rate of the Slovak koruna in the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II). The central rate of the Slovak koruna has been revalued by 17.6472 percent. The new central rate of the koruna is 1 euro = 30.1260 koruna. The standard fluctuation band of plus or minus 15 percent continues to be observed around the central rate of the Slovak koruna. The revaluation of the central rate of the Slovak koruna is justified by ongoing improvements in underlying fundamentals. It will support the authorities in maintaining macroeconomic stability. The revaluation is based on a firm commitment by the authorities to pursue appropriate supportive policies, aimed in particular at maintaining price stability in a sustainable manner, underpinning external competitiveness and strengthening economic resilience. These policies include: strengthening the pace of fiscal adjustment in structural terms in 2008 and ensuring an annual average structural adjustment of at least 0.5 % of GDP from 2009 onwards, in line with the Council opinion adopted on 12 February 2008 on the updated convergence programme of Slovakia; adopting, if necessary, an even tighter fiscal stance should additional inflationary pressures arise; promoting wage developments which reflect labour productivity growth, in particular in the public sector; further structural reforms to enhance the institutional framework in the areas of education and R&D, to foster the better functioning of labour markets (in particular by tackling the combination of a high structural unemployment rate, regional disparities and emerging skill mismatches) and to improve the business environment in order to raise productivity growth. The Slovak authorities will ensure an efficient price setting in regulated industries, in particular in the energy sector. They will continue to closely monitor financial stability to prevent relaxation of credit standards and to ensure proper accounting for credit risks. The authorities, together with the responsible EU bodies, will closely monitor macroeconomic and exchange rate developments. The authorities commit to strengthen the policy stance as warranted. This decision is without prejudice to the possible decision of the Council pertaining to Article 122(2) of the Treaty. The new compulsory intervention rates in the ERM II have been set at 34.6449 and 25.6071 and are immediately effective at the opening of the foreign exchange markets on 29 May 2008.

ECB Decisions The Governing Council of the ECB has decided to take joint action with the Federal Reserve by offering US dollar funding to Eurosystem counterparties. The Eurosystem shall conduct two US dollar liquidity-providing operations, in connection with the US dollar Term Auction Facility, against ECB-eligible collateral for a maturity of 28 and 35 days.

It is reminded that the Governing Council previously decided on 8 November 2007 to renew at maturity the two supplementary longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) that were allotted in August and September 2007.

"356","The Eurosystem’s liquidity management measures related to the year-end 2007","The Eurosystem’s liquidity management measures related to the year-end 2007 30 November 2007 Against the background of some tensions in the euro money market in connection with the upcoming end of year, the ECB has already confirmed on 23 November 2007 that, in line with its aim to keep very short term money market interest rates close to the minimum bid rate in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations, it would reinforce its policy of allotting more than the benchmark allotment amount in main refinancing operations for as long as needed and at least until after the end of the year. Moreover, on 8 November 2007 the Governing Council decided to renew the two supplementary longer-term refinancing operations which both cover the end of the year. As an additional measure, the Governing Council decided yesterday, by means of a teleconference, to lengthen the maturity of the main refinancing operation settling on 19 December 2007 to two weeks. The new maturity date will be on 4 January 2008 instead of 28 December 2007. In this operation, the ECB will aim to satisfy the banking sector’s liquidity needs for the entire two-week period, covering both the Christmas holidays and the end of the year. The allotment amount in this operation will be decided in full consistency with the aim of keeping interest rates close to the minimum bid rate. The main refinancing operation settling on 28 December 2007 will allow potential further liquidity demands to be satisfied. The ECB continues to monitor liquidity conditions in order to keep very short term rates close to the minimum bid rate. In this regard it continues to aim at balanced liquidity conditions at the end of the maintenance period. If needed, the ECB also stands ready to steer liquidity towards more balanced conditions earlier in the maintenance period.

"359","Amendments to Annex I (General Documentation) and Annex II (Additional Minimum Common Features) to Guideline ECB/2000/7 on monetary policy instruments and procedures","Amendments to Annex I (General Documentation) and Annex II (Additional Minimum Common Features) to Guideline ECB/2000/7 on monetary policy instruments and procedures 30 October 2007 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has adopted Guideline ECB/2007/10, amending Guideline ECB/2000/7 on monetary policy instruments and procedures of the Eurosystem. The amendments pertain to: the document entitled “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” (referred to as the “General Documentation”), which is Annex I to the Guideline, and Annex II to the Guideline, setting out the “Additional Minimum Common Features”. The amendments mainly take account of recent decisions by the Governing Council and relate, in particular, to the following four topics: Monetary policy instruments: After reviewing the monetary policy instruments, the Governing Council has decided to remove the option of employing outright transactions for fine-tuning operations. This instrument has never been used in the past. At the same time, the Governing Council has retained the option of using outright transactions for structural operations. Eligible assets: The changes relating to assets eligible for Eurosystem credit operations primarily reflect decisions previously taken by the Governing Council:- The Governing Council decided on 25 May 2007 an amendment to the calendar for phasing out marketable tier two assets. Marketable assets, which have been issued prior to 31 May 2007 and are traded on non-regulated markets that currently fulfil the Eurosystem’s requirements for safety and accessibility, but not for transparency, will remain eligible until 31 December 2009 and will become ineligible thereafter.- The Governing Council specified on 25 May 2007 that, with the exception of international or supranational institutions, issuers of marketable assets eligible for Eurosystem credit operations must be established either in the European Economic Area (EEA) or in one of the four non-EEA G10 countries. Thus, assets issued by entities domiciled outside the EEA or the non-EEA G10 countries are not eligible, irrespective of whether a guarantee by an entity established in the EEA is available. Marketable assets issued before 1 January 2007 that were issued by an entity not established in the EEA or in one of the non-EEA-G10 countries but guaranteed by an entity established in the EEA remain eligible until 31 December 2011 and will become ineligible after that date.- The Governing Council decided on 22 February 2007 to amend the credit assessment for covered bank bonds. Covered bank bonds issued from 1 January 2008 are treated in the same way as all other marketable assets by subjecting them to the same rating requirements. For covered bank bonds that are issued before 1 January 2008, the old credit assessment will apply until their maturity. Accordingly, these covered bank bonds are deemed to fulfil the Eurosystem credit standards if they comply strictly with the criteria set out in Article 22(4) of the UCITS Directive. The change aims at streamlining and simplifying the collateral framework and does not impact the eligibility of the covered bank bonds as these generally fulfil the rating requirements of the Eurosystem.- The Governing Council clarified its decision of 13 January 2006, specifying that units of French fonds communs de créance (FCCs) issued prior to 1 May 2006 will remain eligible for a transitional period until 31 December 2008 but that FCCs issued on or after 1 May 2006 will not be eligible. Target2: On 26 April 2007 the Governing Council adopted Guideline ECB/2007/2 on a Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system (TARGET2), establishing the TARGET2 system, which replaces the current TARGET system as laid down in Article 14.2 of Guideline ECB/2007/2. National central banks will migrate to TARGET2 in accordance with the schedule specified in Article 13 of Guideline ECB/2007/2. To reflect the new system, amendments have been introduced to Annexes I and II to Guideline ECB/2000/7. Euro area enlargement: In its decision of 10 July 2007, the Governing Council concluded that Cyprus and Malta have fulfilled the conditions necessary to adopt the euro on 1 January 2008. To reflect the enlargement of euro area, some smaller amendments became necessary to the General Documentation. Amendments to Annexes I and II to Guideline ECB/2000/7 relating to aspects 1) to 3) listed above will apply from 19 November 2007. Amendments relating to the euro area enlargement listed under point 4) above will apply from 1 January 2008.

"364","Statement by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank","Statement by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank 14 August 2007 As I indicated after the Governing Council meeting on 2 August, the European Central Bank has paid great attention to the developments in the market. We have provided in particular the liquidity which was needed to permit an orderly functioning of the money market. We experience a period of market nervousness, a period in which we see increased volatility in many markets and a significant re-appreciation of risks. In some respects, what has been observed can be interpreted as a normalisation of the pricing of risk. We are now seeing money market conditions that have gone progressively back to normal. The Eurosystem will continue to monitor the situation whilst euro area financial markets in general are going back to normal functioning. As I did after our last meeting, I call on all parties concerned to continue to keep their composure. This attitude has been welcome and effective in the recent days. It will help to consolidate a smooth return to a normal assessment of risks in liquid markets.

"366","First Release of Daily Euro Area Government Bond Yield Curves","First Release of Daily Euro Area Government Bond Yield Curves 10 July 2007 The European Central Bank (ECB) is today publishing for the first time yield curves estimated from euro area central government debt securities denominated in euro. From now on, the ECB will release every working day a set of nominal yield curves based on AAA-rated euro-denominated bonds issued by euro area central governments, covering the maturity spectrum from three months up to 30 years. In addition, euro area yield curves covering all euro area central government bonds and the spreads between both curves will be released. The yield curves, both past and present, can be accessed via an interactive ECB webpage. A yield curve represents the relationship between the market remuneration rate (based on the interest rate and the market price) and the remaining time to maturity of bonds with a similar risk profile, at a certain moment. It is also known as the term structure of interest rates. The euro area yield curves use Svensson’s extension of the Nelson-Siegel model; the model parameters are also released daily. Since AAA-rated central government bonds are considered to reflect the lowest credit default risk, a yield curve computed on the basis of these bonds provides a floor for the borrowing costs in the euro area and thereby constitutes a useful benchmark for assessing the capital markets’ remuneration rates for other types of bonds with the same residual maturities. The euro area yield curves can also assist in gauging market expectations of economic and financial activity over a medium to long-term horizon. Moreover, they provide valuable information for financial market analyses and for financial stability purposes, for instance because they provide an indication of the path of future financing costs and their possible implications for the financial system. The ECB yield curves will also serve as a reference for other international and European institutions, such as the European Commission. The yield curves are based on a selection of the most liquid and representative euro area central government bonds. They reflect the end-of-day market prices of the previous business day. At present, approximately 160 and 265 government bonds are used, respectively, to calculate the euro area “AAA” and “all” yield curves. Currently, the euro area yield curves are relatively flat because of the small differences between the market remuneration rates for long-term and short-term government bonds in the euro area. In recent months, the upward slopes of the central government bond yield curves have steepened somewhat because long-term government bond yields have increased more than short-term government bond yields. For example, concerning the “AAA” curve, yesterday’s closing yield for government bonds with a 10-year and 30-year maturity equalled 4.62% and 4.77%, respectively, which was 71and 69 basis points higher than on 29 December 2006. Over the same period, the yield of a government bond with a remaining time to maturity of three months has increased by 49 basis points, from 3.44% to 3.93%. So, the main slope of today’s yield curve, which is the difference between the yield on a bond with a 10-year maturity and that of a bond with a three-month maturity, equals 69 basis points, while it was 47 basis points at the end of last year. The spread between today’s “AAA” euro area and “All” euro area yield curves equals 5 basis points for the 10-year maturity and 12 basis points for the 30-year maturity. The euro area yield curves will be published on the ECB’s website every TARGET working day at 12 noon (Central European Time or Central European Summer Time, respectively). Yield curves are available from 29 December 2006 onwards. The yield curves and a description of the methodology used to estimate them can be found on the ECB’s website at http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money/yc/html/index.en.html.

"368","Publication of a report on the euro bonds and derivatives markets","Publication of a report on the euro bonds and derivatives markets 26 June 2007 The European Central Bank (ECB) is today publishing a report entitled “The euro bonds and derivatives markets”. The report describes major developments in markets for euro-denominated bonds and related derivatives over the past eight years. Like its predecessor, “The euro bond market study” of December 2004, it focuses on developments that are predominantly structural and, as such, of a longer-term nature. The study shows that markets for euro-denominated bonds, although still young institutional arrangements, have already achieved a high level of efficiency. Private sector issuers are increasingly entering these markets as liquidity conditions improve. Electronic trading is advancing, and efficient derivatives markets complement bond trading. On a global level, the share of euro-denominated bonds in world bond markets is rising. The report is available on the ECB’s website.

"370","Publication of corporate finance in the euro area structural issues report","Publication of corporate finance in the euro area structural issues report 11 June 2007 Today the European Central Bank (ECB) publishes the ECB’s Structural issues Report, which this year deals with “Corporate Finance in the euro area”. This is an annual ECB publication, which will be formally presented to the European Parliament during today’s hearing of the ECB’s President, Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet, at the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the Parliament. Each year the report will be prepared under the aegis of the ECB’s Governing Council, which would identify a topic on structural aspects of the euro area economy relevant for monetary policy. The report will analyse this topic from a euro area and cross-country perspective, based on input from the staff of the ECB and of the national central banks (NCBs) of the euro area. The aim of this year’s report of this year is to analyse the main features of the functioning of the market for corporate finance in the euro area, including the specifics of the national markets and the conditions applicable to the borrowers. Given the great interest in the issue of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) access to finance, the report also analyses how financing patterns differ across large, medium and small enterprises. Finally, the report discusses the recent trends observed in the corporate finance landscape of the euro area over the past few years and how they have influenced the availability of external finance for firms. If you would like to receive a hard copy of this report, please contact the ECB’s Press and Information Division at the address provided below.

"372","Amendment to the criteria for assets eligible as collateral for eurosystem credit operations","Amendment to the criteria for assets eligible as collateral for eurosystem credit operations 25 May 2007 The European Central Bank (ECB) is today providing further details on the assets eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations. As a result of the completion of the single collateral framework on 1 January 2007, the Eurosystem has specified that, with the exception of international or supranational institutions, issuers of marketable assets eligible for Eurosystem credit operations must be established either in the European Economic Area (EEA) or in one of the four non-EEA G10 countries [1]. Thus, assets issued by entities domiciled outside the EEA or the non-EEA G10 countries will not be eligible, irrespective of whether a guarantee by an entity established in the EEA is available. Against this background, these tier one assets will lose eligibility on 1 June 2007. However, assets issued before 1 January 2007 will be grandfathered until 31 December 2011 and will only become ineligible after that date. This decision is in line with the eligibility criteria on the place of establishment for marketable assets listed in section 6.2.1 of “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General Documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” (generally known as the “General Documentation”). [1] The European Economic Area consists of the 27 countries of the European Union, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The four non-EEA G10 countries are Canada, Japan, Switzerland and the United States.

"378","Joint communiqué on the Slovak koruna","Joint communiqué on the Slovak koruna 16 March 2007 At the request of the Slovak authorities, the ministers of the euro-area Member States of the European Community, the European Central Bank and the ministers and the central bank governors of Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Slovakia have decided, by mutual agreement, following a common procedure involving the European Commission and after consultation of the Economic and Financial Committee, to adapt the central rate of the Slovak koruna in the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II). The central rate of the Slovak koruna has been revalued by 8 ½ percent. The new central rate of the koruna is: 1 euro = 35.4424 koruna The standard fluctuation band of plus or minus 15 percent continues to be observed around the central rate of the Slovak koruna. The revaluation of the central rate of the Slovak koruna is justified by underlying fundamentals. It will support the authorities in maintaining macroeconomic stability. The revaluation is based on a firm commitment by the authorities to pursue appropriate supportive policies, aimed in particular at achieving price stability in a sustainable manner and underpinning external competitiveness and economic resilience. These include: strengthening the fiscal adjustment path in structural terms, in line with the Council opinion adopted on 27 February 2007 on the updated convergence programme of Slovakia, in order to contribute to a balanced policy-mix aimed at containing inflationary risks and supporting the sustainability of the convergence process; the promotion of wage developments which reflect labour productivity growth, labour market conditions and competitiveness; and the continuous pursuit of structural reforms so as to raise productivity growth and improve the functioning of product, labour and financial markets. In addition, the Slovak authorities will be vigilant concerning risks of strong credit growth. The authorities, together with the responsible EU bodies, will closely monitor macroeconomic and exchange rate developments. The authorities commit to strengthen the policy stance as warranted. This decision is without prejudice to the conclusions that will be reached by the Commission and the ECB in future convergence reports and to possible decisions of the Council pertaining to Article 122(2) of the Treaty. The compulsory intervention points in the exchange-rate mechanism will be communicated by the ECB and the National Bank of Slovakia, in time for the opening of the foreign exchange markets on 19 March 2007.

The report contains the results of an analysis of euro area money market developments in 2006, carried out by experts from the ECB and the national central banks of the European Union as part of the regular market monitoring and analysis activities of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The study shows that the aggregated turnover of the euro money market increased strongly in the second quarter of 2006, after two years of slow growth. This increase was particularly strong for overnight indexed swaps (EONIA swaps), forward rate agreements and other interest rate swaps, which recorded a year-on-year growth rate of over 40%. The study also confirms that the secured (repo) segment remains the largest euro money market segment. This study follows up on similar studies conducted since 1999. The results of the last study were published on 3 May 2005 in a report entitled “Euro Money Market Study 2004”. A set of charts presenting the data of the 2005 survey was published on 20 January 2006, as an annex to the previous study. The 2006 report is available on the ECB’s website, as are the previous reports and survey results. Hard copies can be obtained from the ECB’s Press and Information Division.

"383","Development of the euro area monetary financial institutions sector","Development of the euro area monetary financial institutions sector 3 January 2007 On 1 January 2007 the total number of monetary financial institutions (MFIs [1] ) resident in the countries of the euro area stood at 7,646. Of these MFIs, more than 80% were credit institutions and most of the remainder were money market funds. Since 1 January 1999 the number of MFIs in the euro area has decreased by 22% (2,210 MFIs), despite the enlargement of the euro area on 1 January 2001 and 1 January 2007. Two countries (Germany and France) account for almost 50% of all euro area MFIs. The European Central Bank (ECB) is today publishing updated versions of the “List of monetary financial institutions” and the “List of monetary financial institutions and institutions subject to minimum reserves” on its website. Both lists relate to the MFI sectors of the euro area and the European Union as at 1 January 2007. The “List of monetary financial institutions” serves as a register and is updated on a daily basis on the ECB’s website. From 1 January 2007 it classifies MFIs resident in Slovenia as euro area MFIs and categorises MFIs resident in Bulgaria and Romania as European Union MFIs. The “List of monetary financial institutions and institutions subject to minimum reserves” is updated on the last business day of every month on the ECB’s website. Number of MFIs On 1 January 2007 there were 7,646 MFIs resident in the euro area. This represents a decrease of 264 units (3.4%) compared with 1 January 2006. At the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union on 1 January 1999 there were 9,856 MFIs in the euro area. This represents a net decrease of 2,210 units (22.4%) in eight years, despite the inclusion of 105 MFIs when the euro was adopted by Greece on 1 January 2001 and 30 MFIs when the euro was adopted by Slovenia on 1 January 2007. This trend is clearly visible in Chart 1 below. Similarly, the number of MFIs resident in the European Union declined from 10,909 on 1 January 1999 to 10,191 on 1 January 2007, despite the inclusion of 1,608 MFIs on 1 May 2004, when ten new Member States acceded to the European Union, and the inclusion of 72 MFIs on 1 January 2007, when Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU. Structure of the MFI sector On 1 January 2007 credit institutions accounted for 80.5% (6,157 units) of all euro area MFIs, while money market funds accounted for 19.3% (1,472 units). Central banks including the ECB (14 units), and other institutions (3 units), together accounted for 0.2% of all euro area MFIs. In the European Union as a whole, the shares of credit institutions and money market funds were 83.5% and 15.7% respectively. Country breakdown On 1 January 2007 two countries accounted for almost 50% (3,546) of all MFIs in the euro area: Germany (27%) and France (19%). Italy and Austria each accounted for around 11% of the euro area total. While Ireland is the only euro area country where the number of MFIs has increased in the past eight years, the largest decreases in relative terms have occurred in Spain and the Netherlands (declines of 29% and 27% respectively between 2004 and 2007). Among the non-euro area countries, Poland has by far the largest number of MFIs (729), representing 7% of European Union MFIs. The United Kingdom and Cyprus have 440 and 337 respectively. In the last three years the number of MFIs has notably increased in Malta (by 35%), Latvia (by 25%) and Slovakia (by 21%), while the largest decreases in relative terms have occurred in the Czech Republic and Cyprus (declines of 16% and 18% respectively).

"387","New version of “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures”","New version of “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” 15 September 2006 The European Central Bank (ECB) is today publishing a revised version of the document entitled “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” (referred to as the “General Documentation”). The new version is an annex to Guideline ECB/2006/12 amending Guideline ECB/2000/7 on monetary policy instruments and procedures of the Eurosystem. The amending Guideline has been adopted by the ECB’s Governing Council and will be applicable from 1 January 2007. The amendments mainly relate to the introduction of non-marketable assets in the Eurosystem's collateral framework and represent the final step in the gradual introduction of a single framework for eligible collateral, common to all Eurosystem credit operations (also referred to as the “Single List”). This single framework replaces the two-tier collateral system that has been in place since the start of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) – see previous press releases of 5 August 2004 – entitled “Review of the Eurosystem’s collateral framework: second step towards a single list” – and 22 July 2005 entitled “Eurosystem collateral framework: Inclusion of non-marketable assets in the Single List”. This single framework for eligible collateral comprises two distinct asset classes – marketable and non-marketable assets. The Eurosystem has defined specific eligibility criteria and a specific credit assessment framework for the non-marketable assets that are uniform across the euro area in order to ensure that these assets comply with similar collateral standards as marketable assets. Furthermore, specific operational procedures were developed for the safe transfer and mobilisation of non-marketable assets. For a specific asset type within non-marketable assets – credit claims (also often referred to as bank loans) – an interim period until 31 December 2011 is foreseen, in which a limited number of eligibility and operational criteria will still be different across the euro area. In particular, in this interim period, the national central banks may choose the minimum threshold for the size of credit claims eligible for use as collateral and may decide whether a handling fee should be applied for their use. The original two-tier collateral framework was adopted by the Eurosystem to ensure a smooth transition to the euro. Assets were divided into two tiers in order to accommodate differences in financial structures between Member States at the beginning of EMU. Tier one assets consisted of marketable assets that fulfilled euro-area wide eligibility criteria, while tier two assets comprised assets deemed of particular importance at the national level, for which specific eligibility criteria were established by the national central banks. Tier-two assets that do not qualify under the eligibility criteria for the single framework will be phased out by 31 May 2007. The Eurosystem will continue to monitor the adequacy of its collateral framework. In particular, it will pay close attention to the functioning of the new framework for non-marketable assets. The English version of the document can be obtained in electronic format from the ECB’s website, as from 3 p.m. ECB time (CET) today. Versions in other official Community languages will be made available at a later stage. Hard copies will be available, free of charge, as from 24 October 2006 and can be ordered in writing from the ECB’s Press and Information Division or from any of the EU national central banks.

"388","Assessment of STEP for collateral purposes in Eurosystem credit operations","Assessment of STEP for collateral purposes in Eurosystem credit operations 15 September 2006 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) yesterday decided that the Short-Term European Paper (STEP) market will be accepted as a non-regulated market for collateral purposes in Eurosystem credit operations, as soon as the STEP statistics on yields are published on the ECB’s website. The ECB will be able to publish such yield statistics as soon as the input data become available and are of sufficient quality to produce reliable statistics. Further details will be provided before the end of 2006. The STEP initiative aims to foster the integration and development of the European markets for short-term securities through convergence towards the best market standards, which are described in the STEP Market Convention. Information on STEP can be obtained on the STEP Market website (http://www.stepmarket.org). In order to be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem operations, notes issued under STEP-compliant programmes will also have to comply with all the eligibility criteria listed in Chapter 6 of “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” (http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo). The Governing Council assessed the STEP market on the basis of the provisions of the STEP Market Convention and related documents. Retention of the acceptability status will depend on the strict implementation of such provisions.

This survey is part of the regular monitoring activities of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). Although the survey is carried out every year, the ESCB only publishes a complete report every two years. The last complete report relating to the annual survey, entitled “Euro Money Market Study 2004”, was published on 3 May 2005.

"398","Amendments to “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” relating to asset-backed securities","Amendments to “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” relating to asset-backed securities 13 January 2006 The European Central Bank (ECB) is today publishing amendments to the document entitled “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” (referred to as the “General Documentation”) in order to clarify the criteria on which the eligibility of asset-backed securities for use in Eurosystem credit operations is assessed. In the past, the Eurosystem has not applied specific eligibility criteria to asset-backed securities, which belong to the category of debt instruments. Instead, it has interpreted the general tier one eligibility criterion stipulating that debt instruments must have “a fixed, unconditional principal amount” as excluding those asset-backed securities in which the credit risk has been transferred to a special purpose vehicle using credit derivatives. The amendments have therefore been introduced to increase the overall transparency of the collateral framework by specifying the precise criteria that have to be fulfilled by asset-backed securities in addition to the criteria applicable to debt instruments in general. As a result of the introduction of the new criteria, it has also been decided that the “fixed, unconditional principal amount” requirement will no longer apply to asset-backed securities. This is because the principal amount of all asset-backed securities is usually dependent on the performance of the underlying assets. The new criteria relate to the following five aspects: The structure of the transaction. The cash-flow generating assets must be legally acquired in accordance with the laws of a Member State from the originator or an intermediary by the securitisation special purpose vehicle in a manner which the Eurosystem considers to be a “true sale” that is enforceable against any third party. They must be beyond the reach of the originator and its creditors, including in the event of the originator’s insolvency. The composition of the pool of assets. The cash-flow generating assets must not consist of credit-linked notes or similar claims resulting from the transfer of credit risk by means of credit derivatives. The seniority of the tranches. Debt instruments affording rights to the principal and/or the interest that are subordinated to the rights of holders of other debt instruments of the same issuer (or, within a structured issue, subordinated to other tranches of the same issue) are excluded from tier one. A tranche (or sub-tranche) is considered to be non-subordinated vis-à-vis other tranches (or sub-tranches) of the same issue and is “senior” if – in accordance with the priority of payment applicable after the delivery of an enforcement notice, as set out in the offering circular – that tranche (or sub-tranche) receives payment (principal and interest) in priority to other tranches or other sub-tranches or is last in incurring losses in relation to underlying assets. The issuer’s country of residence. Asset-backed securities issued by entities established in the G10 countries that are not part of the European Economic Area (EEA) – currently the United States, Canada, Japan and Switzerland – are not eligible. This criterion is introduced to avoid the additional legal complexities that would arise if the Eurosystem needed to assess whether its rights were sufficiently protected under the laws of such countries. The eligibility assessment. The Eurosystem reserves the right to request from any relevant third party (such as the issuer, the originator or the arranger) any clarification and/or legal confirmation that it considers necessary to assess the eligibility of asset-backed securities. Note, however, that the above criteria as well as the exception from the “fixed, unconditional principal amount” requirement do not apply to covered bank bonds issued in accordance with Art 22(4) of the UCITS Directive (85/611/EEC as amended). The General Documentation including the above amendments is an annex to Guideline ECB/2005/17 amending Guideline ECB/2000/7 on monetary policy instruments and procedures of the Eurosystem. The amending Guideline has been adopted by the Governing Council of the ECB and the amendments will apply from 1 May 2006. Asset-backed securities which are eligible pursuant to Guideline ECB/2005/2 but do not fulfil the above criteria will remain eligible for a transitional period until 15 October 2006. The Governing Council has also decided that units of French fonds communs de créances (FCCs) in the tier one list will remain eligible for a transitional period until 30 December 2008.

"409","First step towards the introduction of the single list of collateral provided for in the revised version of the “General Documentation”","First step towards the introduction of the single list of collateral provided for in the revised version of the “General Documentation” 30 May 2005 As announced in a press release on 21 February 2005, the revised version of the document entitled “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” (generally referred to as the “General Documentation”) entered into force today. The amendments include all changes to the Eurosystem’s operational framework for monetary policy that have been approved by the Governing Council since February 2004. These changes mainly relate to the rules for eligible assets and are linked to the implementation within the Eurosystem monetary policy framework of the first phase of the “single list of collateral”. The most important of these changes are summarised below. Introduction into the list of tier one assets of euro-denominated debt instruments issued by entities established in the G10 countries that are not part of the European Economic Area As of 1 July 2005, selected debt instruments issued by entities established in the G10 countries that are not part of the European Economic Area (currently the United States, Canada, Japan and Switzerland) will be added to the list of eligible assets that is published on the ECB’s website. It is important to note that only those debt instruments that fulfil the Eurosystem’s eligibility criteria for tier one assets, including the requirement of being denominated in euro, and that are covered, in addition, by a legal assessment on the applicable legal framework and on the rules that would apply to the enforcement of Eurosystem rights will be included as of that date. Should a counterparty wish to use as collateral debt instruments that belong to the category defined here, but are not yet on the list of eligible assets in effect as of 1 July 2005, it should contact its national central bank (NCB) for guidance on the procedures for their possible inclusion. Debt instruments issued by credit institutions The criterion that uncovered debt instruments issued by credit institutions should have an “issue” or “programme” rating has been abolished; an “issuer” rating is now sufficient. The debt instruments that have become eligible as a result of this change are now included in the list of eligible assets published on the ECB’s website. Debt instruments listed, quoted or traded on a non-regulated market Following the publication of a provisional list of non-regulated markets that are accepted by the Eurosystem as complying with its collateral framework (see also the Review of the Eurosystem’s Collateral Framework: First step towards a Single List, published on 10 May 2004), the ECB is today publishing the complete list of accepted non-regulated markets (see Table 1). Assets listed, quoted or traded on an accepted non-regulated market are immediately eligible if they fulfil all the other eligibility criteria set out in Section 6.2 of the “General Documentation”. Table 1 Location of the market Name of the market Belgium The OTC market for Belgian Treasury bills (BTB) Germany The unofficial market (“Freiverkehr”) of a German exchange The MTS Deutschland market for Bubills France Government securities (Bons du Trésor: BTF/BTAN) markets French commercial paper (billets de trésorerie) market French Medium-Term Notes (BMTN) market Netherlands The OTC money market for Dutch Treasury Certificates (DTC) Austria Third market (“Dritter Markt”) Finland The money market for Treasury bills (Finnish Treasury Bill Programme) MTS Finland United Kingdom OTC market for Bank of England Euro Bills The list in Table 1 will be reassessed at least annually. It is recalled that currently eligible assets that do not fulfil the criterion of being listed, quoted or traded on one of the non-regulated markets given in Table 1 will remain eligible until May 2007. After that date, any assets that continue to be exchanged only on non-accepted markets will no longer be eligible.

"411","Update of the assessment of securities settlement systems","Update of the assessment of securities settlement systems 21 April 2005 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank has updated the assessment of securities settlement systems (SSSs) eligible for the settlement of collateral for Eurosystem credit operations. SSSs are periodically assessed against the “Standards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in ESCB credit operations” published by the European Monetary Institute in 1998. Since 1 July 2003 only securities issued and held in an SSS located in the euro area have been eligible for Eurosystem credit operations. As a result, SSSs located outside the euro area do not handle Eurosystem collateral and are therefore no longer assessed by the Eurosystem. Accordingly, only 18 SSSs have been assessed in 2004, compared with 21 in 2003. The overall level of compliance with the standards is high, and the SSSs have maintained their efforts to enhance compliance further. The eligible SSSs and their settlement procedures are set out in the table below, which replaces the list published in a press release on 26 April 2004. Table: Settlement procedures in eligible SSSs SSS (country) Procedures used for Eurosystem credit operations Other procedures not used by the Eurosystem NBB SSS (Belgium) Free of payment (FOP) multiple-batch settlement.

"415","New version of “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures”","New version of “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” 21 February 2005 The European Central Bank (ECB) is today publishing a revised version of the document entitled “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” (generally referred to as the “General Documentation”). The new version is an annex to Guideline ECB/2005/2 amending Guideline ECB/2000/7 on monetary policy instruments and procedures of the Eurosystem. The amending Guideline has been adopted by the ECB’s Governing Council. The amendments will apply from 30 May 2005 when the new version of the General Documentation replaces the previous version published in February 2004. The amendments include all changes to the Eurosystem’s operational framework for monetary policy endorsed by the Governing Council since February 2004. These changes mainly relate to the rules for eligible assets and are linked to the introduction in the Eurosystem monetary policy framework of the first phase of the “single list of collateral”. Other amendments concern the definition of close links and guarantors in counterparty relationships, the increase by 30 minutes of the timeframe for quick tenders and the updating of legal references. The changes relating to the introduction of the single list of collateral consist of the following four measures: the introduction into the tier one list of eligible assets of a new category of previously ineligible collateral, namely euro-denominated debt instruments issued by entities established in those G10 countries that are not part of the European Economic Area (EEA); the implementation of the principles used by the Eurosystem to assess the acceptability of non‑regulated markets in order for the Eurosystem to perform its collateral management function; the relaxation of the criterion for tier one assets requiring every debt instrument issued by a credit institution to be awarded an “issue” or “programme” rating (by a rating agency); an “issuer” rating will be sufficient; and the withdrawal of equities (as of 30 April 2005) from the tier two lists of eligible assets of central banks that currently list equities as eligible collateral for Eurosystem credit operations. As a result of the first measure, certain euro-denominated debt instruments that are issued by entities established in Canada, Japan, Switzerland and the United States will be included on the list of eligible assets. The Eurosystem will examine the legal regime applicable to the issuers of such debt instruments to ensure adequate protection of the Eurosystem’s rights. If a counterparty wishes to use debt instruments that are not on the list of eligible assets, it should contact its national central bank (NCB) for guidance on the procedures for their possible inclusion. Soon after 30 May the ECB will announce the exact date of the introduction of the first non-EEA G10 euro-denominated debt instruments onto the list of eligible assets. With regard to the second measure on the acceptability of non-regulated markets, a preliminary list of accepted non-regulated markets was published by the ECB on 10 May 2004 (see the press release “Review of the Eurosystem’s Collateral Framework: First step towards a Single List”). A final list will be published on 30 May 2005. This list will subsequently be reassessed at least annually. The following will apply: Assets listed, quoted or traded on an accepted non-regulated market will be immediately eligible. Assets listed, quoted or traded only on non-regulated markets that are currently accepted but will not be accepted as of 30 May 2005 will continue to remain acceptable until May 2007, after which any assets exchanged only on markets that are still non-acceptable will become ineligible. The new version of the General Documentation is available on the ECB’s website in all the official Community languages from today. Hard copies of the printed version will be available free of charge as of 25 March 2005 and can be ordered from the ECB’s Press and Information Division. It will also be distributed by the euro area NCBs.

Following the positive response to this initiative, the Governing Council of the ECB approved the gradual introduction of a “Single List” in the collateral framework of the Eurosystem (see Press Release of 10 May 2004) to replace the current two-tier system of eligible collateral. The ECB also announced that, as a first step, it intended to introduce in its collateral framework a new category of previously ineligible assets (euro-denominated debt instruments issued by entities established in those Group of Ten countries that are not part of the European Economic Area). As a second step, the Governing Council has approved in principle the inclusion in the Single List of bank loans from all euro area countries. The exact modalities and timing for the eligibility of bank loans will be communicated in due course once the outstanding implementation issues have been settled. The Governing Council has also decided that non-marketable retail mortgage-backed debt instruments, which currently only include Irish mortgage-backed promissory notes, shall be included in the Single List. Finally, the Governing Council has also decided that equities, which are currently eligible as tier two collateral in Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal, shall not be included in the Single List. These assets will therefore be phased out from eligibility according to a specific timetable, to be communicated in due course.

"429","Review of the Eurosystem’s Collateral Framework: First step towards a Single List","Review of the Eurosystem’s Collateral Framework: First step towards a Single List 10 May 2004 On 11 June 2003 the Eurosystem launched a public consultation to gather the views of market participants on measures to improve the collateral framework of the Eurosystem. Following the positive response to this initiative, the Governing Council of the ECB has approved in principle the introduction of a “Single List” in the collateral framework of the Eurosystem. The purpose of having a Single List is to enhance the level playing field in the euro area, to further promote equal treatment for counterparties and issuers, and to increase the overall transparency of the collateral framework. The Governing Council has decided that the Single List will be introduced gradually and that, ultimately, it will replace the current two-tier system of eligible collateral. In the current system, tier one comprises only debt instruments that comply with euro area-wide eligibility criteria; tier two comprises assets that are approved by national central banks and includes debt instruments that do not comply with euro area-wide eligibility criteria, as well as equities and non-marketable assets such as bank loans. The first step towards establishing the Single List will comprise the following two measures: the introduction into tier one of a new category of previously ineligible collateral, namely euro-denominated debt instruments issued by entities established in those Group of Ten (G10) countries that are not part of the European Economic Area (EEA); changes in the eligibility criteria relating to some marketable debt instruments. This first step will be implemented by May 2005. In order for the Governing Council’s decision to become fully operational, some more implementation work has to be carried out by the Eurosystem before the date of implementation. Market participants will receive regular updates on the progress achieved in implementing the revised eligibility rules to allow adequate lead-times for the required operational changes. When the first step has been implemented, most currently eligible marketable debt instruments will continue to be eligible in the Single List. A limited number of currently eligible assets will lose their eligibility status and will be phased out over a period of 36 months. As a consequence of the changes caused by the introduction of the Single List in the collateral framework, a revision of the eligibility criteria will take place. These changes will be reflected in a revised version of the ECB document entitled “The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area: General Documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures”, the next version of which is expected to be published around April 2005. More detailed information on the precise changes to the eligibility criteria will be given closer to the enforcement date. Further measures concerning the eligibility of additional tier two assets in the Single List will require new decisions by the ECB’s Governing Council. Consistency between past and future decisions will be ensured. Details on these decisions will be given in due course. Changes planned in the first step of the introduction of the single list Introduction into tier one of euro-denominated debt instruments issued in those G10 countries that are not part of the EEA In order to be eligible, such assets have to be: debt instruments; denominated in euro; issued by entities established in the G10 countries that are not part of the EEA (currently the United States, Canada, Japan and Switzerland); issued in the EEA but settled (i.e. held) in the euro area; supported by an adequate legal assessment (e.g. a “legal opinion”) on the applicable legal framework and the rules that would apply to the enforcement of Eurosystem rights deriving from such debt instruments. Changes in the eligibility criteria relating to some marketable debt instruments Debt instruments listed or quoted on a regulated market Regulated markets that are included in the European Commission’s list drawn up in accordance with the Investment Services Directive[1] (ISD), are currently eligible. Compliance with the ISD listing is considered to be a sufficient condition for a market to be safe, transparent and accessible. These markets will continue to be eligible, with no need for any additional assessment[2]. Debt instruments listed or quoted on a non-regulated market The Eurosystem has devised three “high-level” principles – safety, transparency and accessibility[3] – that should be used to assess well-functioning markets. On the basis of proposals submitted by the Eurosystem national central banks, a practical assessment of the non-regulated markets has been made by the ECB on a case-by-case basis against the three high-level principles. The eligible markets resulting from this assessment are listed in Table 1. Table 2 lists those non-regulated markets which are currently not deemed to be compliant with the high-level principles. In the selection process described above, “markets” are selected, not “assets”. However, the way in which a market is organised and functions can change. If a currently eligible market is assessed to be ineligible under the new rules, the market may still be reorganised to ensure compliance with the high-level principles. This means that the list of eligible markets is not “closed”: the Eurosystem intends to reassess the list of non-regulated markets and publish the list of eligible ones at least annually. In addition, assets issued or exchanged in an ineligible market can “migrate” to an eligible market and thus maintain their eligibility status. As the changes to the rules for eligible markets are expected to imply a (limited) withdrawal of assets from the list of eligible collateral, rules for phasing assets out of this list have been devised. To allow counterparties sufficient time to adjust their balance sheet structure and find alternative eligible collateral, a phasing-out period of 36 months is foreseen, starting from the date of publication of this press release. The phasing-in/out will consist of three stages: the decision on the principle has been announced to market participants today, together with the preliminary list of markets which will be eligible under the new criteria (see Table 1); non-regulated markets to be phased out (see Table 2) will continue to remain eligible until May 2007; in May 2005 a final list of eligible markets will be published, and the first step of the Single List enforced; markets listed in the final list will be eligible immediately for the Single List[4]; in May 2007 the phasing-out period will end and assets exchanged on markets that do not comply with the Single List criteria will become ineligible. Table 1. Preliminary list of non-regulated markets deemed compliant with the high-level principles and thus eligible for the Single List Location of market Name of market Belgium The OTC market for Belgian Treasury Bills Germany The regulated unofficial Market (""Freiverkehr"") of a German exchange The MTS German market for Bu-Bills France Government securities markets (Bons du Trésor: BTF/BTAN) French commercial paper market (billets de trésorerie) French Medium-Term Notes market (BMTN) Netherlands The OTC money market for Dutch Treasury Certificates Finland The money market for treasury bills (Finnish Treasury Bill Programme) MTS Finland Table 2. Preliminary list of non-regulated markets not deemed compliant with the high-level principles for the Single List and to be phased out of the list of eligible markets Location of market Name of market Germany The OTC Bu-Bills market The OTC market for CP Italy The OTC market for debt securities issued by Italian local authorities Netherlands The OTC money market for CP and CD The OTC MTN market Finland The OTC market for CP and Bank CD Debt instruments issued by credit institutions Currently, some specific restrictions are imposed on the eligibility of uncovered debt instruments issued by credit institutions. A simplified set of restrictions will continue to be imposed under the Single List. The criterion which requires uncovered debt instruments issued by credit institutions to be listed or quoted on a regulated market as defined in the ISD will be retained under the Single List. The criterion that each issue should have an issue or programme rating will be relaxed. This simplified set of restrictions will enter into force when the first step of the Single List has been implemented (May 2005). As the changes to the eligibility criteria applying to these assets are not expected to make any currently eligible assets ineligible, no phasing-out rules will be necessary. Marketable debt instruments not complying with the tier one criterion on the financial soundness of the issuer Currently, some marketable debt instruments are included in tier two because the assessment of the financial soundness of the issuer is carried out using methods other than those foreseen for tier one assets.[5] Such assets will remain in tier two at least until the Eurosystem’s overall credit assessment framework to be applied to the Single List of collateral has been finalised (this is planned as a later step in the introduction of the Single List). No phasing-out rules for these assets are therefore required at the moment. Further information on the practical implementation of the first step of the Single List will be provided to market participants closer to the date of enforcement of the measures. [1] Council Directive 93/22/EEC of 10 May 1993 on investment services in the securities field. It should be noted that a revised Directive is being adopted but has not yet been implemented; this new Directive will be referred to as the Directive on Financial Instruments Markets (FIM). [2] The list of ISD-compliant markets is published on the European Commission’s website: http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/finances/mobil/isd/index.htm [3] “Safety”, “transparency” and “accessibility” are defined by the Eurosystem exclusively in view of the performance of the Eurosystem’s collateral management function. The selection process is not aimed at assessing the intrinsic quality of the various markets. The contents of the principles are as follows: Safety is taken to mean certainty with regard to transactions; in particular, certainty on the validity and enforceability of transactions.Transparency is taken to mean unimpeded access to information on: the market’s rules of procedures and operation; the assets’ financial features; the price formation mechanism; the relevant prices and quantities (quotes, interest rates, trading volumes, outstanding amounts, etc.).Accessibility refers to the Eurosystem’s ability to take part in and have access to the market. A market is accessible for collateral management purposes if its rules of procedures and operation allow the Eurosystem to obtain information from it and obtain liquidity from it when needed for these purposes. [4] Given the short-term maturity of the assets to be phased out, counterparties will be allowed to deposit new assets related to the phased-out markets in the national tier two lists until May 2007. [5] Section 6.2 of the “General Documentation” states that tier one assets must fulfil “…high credit standards. In the assessment of the credit standard of debt instruments, the ECB takes into account, inter alia, available ratings by market agencies, guarantees provided by financially sound guarantors, as well as certain institutional criteria which would ensure particularly high protection of the instrument holders…”.

"433","Weekly publication of estimates of average liquidity factors","ECB Weekly publication of estimates of average liquidity factors 5 March 2004 Since June 2000, the European Central Bank (ECB) has published a forecast of the average autonomous liquidity factors each time a main refinancing operation (MRO) is announced. Autonomous factors comprise those items on the consolidated balance sheet of the Eurosystem that are normally not related to monetary policy operations, but that still affect the liquidity position, i.e. the current account holdings of the credit institutions vis-à-vis the Eurosystem. The purpose of publishing a forecast of the average autonomous liquidity factors is to provide useful information for the counterparties when bidding in the MROs and to help them better assess the actual amount allotted by the ECB. Specifically, the forecast can be used by market participants to calculate the benchmark allotment, which is the allotment amount which allows counterparties to smoothly fulfil their reserve requirements in the period up to the day preceding the settlement of the subsequent MRO.[1] However, when making the actual allotment decision in an MRO, which normally occurs one day after it has been announced, the ECB takes into account its updated forecast of the autonomous liquidity factors on the allotment day, which is usually slightly different from the forecast published the day before. In order to prevent these revisions from leading to incorrect assessments of the ECB’s allotment decisions, from 8 March 2004 onwards, the ECB will also publish its updated forecast of the average autonomous liquidity factors as at the allotment day. In addition, on both the day on which an MRO is announced and the day on which it is allotted, the ECB will publish its calculation of the benchmark allotment in the relevant MRO, taking into account its complete forecast of credit institutions’ liquidity needs. This includes the published forecast of the average autonomous liquidity factors as well as an estimate of the liquidity needs stemming from excess reserves, which are credit institutions’ current account holdings in excess of their required reserves. The above information will be provided via newswire services, together with the MRO announcement, at around 3.30 p.m. on the announcement day, while the updated figures, will be provided on the allotment day together with the ECB’s allotment decision, between 11.15 a.m. and 11.20 a.m. Finally, we should like to remind you that the changes to the Eurosystem’s operational framework approved by the Governing Council in January 2003, will be implemented next week.[2] This means that the first maintenance period – defined fully in accordance with the amended framework – will begin on 10 March 2004, and the first MRO with a one-week maturity will be allotted on 9 March 2004. Thus the change in the weekly publications of liquidity conditions will coincide with the changes to the operational framework.

"435","Annual publication of the ""List of monetary financial institutions and institutions subject to minimum reserves"" and the ""List of monetary financial institutions in the accession countries""","ECB Annual publication of the ""List of monetary financial institutions and institutions subject to minimum reserves"" and the ""List of monetary financial institutions in the accession countries"" 27 February 2004 The “List of monetary financial institutions and institutions subject to minimum reserves” (“List of MFIs”) is published by the European Central Bank (ECB) in accordance with Article 3.2 of the Regulation of the European Central Bank of 22 November 2001 concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions sector (ECB/2001/13), as amended, and Article 2.3 of the Regulation of the European Central Bank of 12 September 2003 on the application of minimum reserves (ECB/2003/9). The List of MFIs facilitates the production of a comprehensive and consistent balance sheet for the money-creating sector in the euro area and ensures that the information on the statistical reporting population is as complete, accurate and homogeneous as possible. The list of institutions subject to minimum reserves is based on Article 19.1 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, which empowers the ECB to require credit institutions established in the euro area to hold minimum reserves in pursuance of monetary policy objectives. An updated version of the List of MFIs is published monthly and can be downloaded in text format from the ECB’s website (see below for details). The full list and updates are made available to the public on the last business day of each calendar month. The ECB is also publishing the “List of monetary financial institutions in the accession countries” (“List of AC MFIs”), a comprehensive and homogeneous list of MFIs in the 12 accession countries that are preparing for membership of the European Union (i.e. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia). In order to achieve a high degree of consistency and comparability of information, all countries contributing to the List of AC MFIs have adhered to the ECB’s harmonised definition of MFIs as far as this is possible within their statistical frameworks. The accurate recording of the MFI population in the accession countries is seen as a particularly important contribution to the conceptual and practical harmonisation work necessary to prepare the compilation of monetary aggregates, which are harmonised with euro area definitions. The List of MFIs and the List of AC MFIs concern the monetary financial institutions sectors as at the end of December 2003 and are the seventh and fourth publications in their respective series. Both publications will be made available under the item “Publications”, in the “Monetary Financial Institutions” part of the “MFIs and Eligible assets” section on the ECB’s website. A hard copy of the latest versions can be obtained in writing from the ECB’s Press and Information Division and from any of the EU or accession country central banks.

Regulation ECB/2003/10 of 18 September 2003 amending Regulation ECB/2001/13 takes account of the enlargement of the European Union by extending the collection of quarterly MFI balance sheet statistics on country and currency breakdown to cover the countries acceding to the EU on 1 May 2004. The guidance notes have no binding legal status. Instead, their main purpose is to promote a clear and consistent understanding of the requirements and standards laid down in Regulation ECB/2003/10. To this end, the guidance notes contain definitions, explanations and recommendations regarding the provision of additional country and currency breakdowns due to EU enlargement. These guidance notes are primarily addressed to the statisticians of the national central banks, but may also be of interest to the reporting agents and users of the statistics.

"442","Result of the public consultation on measures to improve the collateral framework of the Eurosystem","ECB Result of the public consultation on measures to improve the collateral framework of the Eurosystem 15 January 2004 On 11 June 2003 the Eurosystem launched a public consultation on the measures to improve the collateral framework of the Eurosystem, and the public was invited to react by 15 September 2003. Market participants actively participated in the consultation procedure, in many cases co-ordinating their answers within representative bodies, submitting 59 responses in total. The European Central Bank (ECB) is publishing today a “summary” of the answers to this public consultation. In general, market participants expressed overall support to the proposal of gradually implementing a single list of eligible collateral throughout the euro area. Further details on the general orientation of the replies are spelled out in the “summary”. The views expressed in this “summary” reflect the opinion of the financial sector industry, as spelt out in the consultation, and should not in any way be attributed to the Eurosystem. The Eurosystem will take into account such views when considering measures to improve the collateral framework. In many of the replies received, the respondents requested the inclusion in the Eurosystem collateral framework of debt instruments denominated in other G10 currencies. This issue is currently being discussed among G10 central banks, and the Eurosystem will consider at a later stage the opportunity to accept such collateral.

These changes relate to: the definition of the maintenance period for minimum reserves (which will always start on the settlement day of the main refinancing operation (MRO) following the Governing Council meeting at which the monthly assessment of the monetary policy stance is pre-scheduled); the standing facilities (changes in the standing facility rates will, as a rule, be implemented on the first day of the new maintenance period); the maturity of the MROs (shortened from two weeks to one week); the execution date for the longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs will be allotted on the last Wednesday of each calendar month); the risk control framework for assets eligible for credit operations with the Eurosystem (liquidity categories will be introduced for tier one assets and haircut levels for tier one and tier two assets will be revised; the calculation of initial margins for assets used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations will be discontinued); a more extensive definition of the characteristics of eligible guarantees for assets. With the adoption on 1 December 2003 of Guideline ECB/2003/16 amending Guideline ECB/2000/7 on monetary policy instruments and procedures of the Eurosystem, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided that the revised framework would enter into force on 8 March 2004 The framework is detailed in an annex to the amending Guideline, entitled “The single monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures” (generally referred to as the “General Documentation”). In order to ensure an orderly transition, some measures will be phased in at the end of January (see the calendar in the annex to this press release).

"449","Implementation of the new risk control framework: liquidity categories and issuer group classification","Implementation of the new risk control framework: liquidity categories and issuer group classification 28 October 2003 In the context of the implementation of the new risk control framework applicable to eligible assets used in Eurosystem credit operations (i.e. intraday liquidity and monetary policy operations) announced in the press release of 2 July 2003, the Governing Council of the ECB has approved the following changes to the risk control framework, which will be reflected in the list of eligible assets published by the ECB in the Eligible Assets Database: The inclusion of two new issuer groups, namely ""Central government"" and ""Local/regional government"" and the removal of the issuer group ""General government"". The breakdown of the issuer group ""Agency"" in two sub-categories, namely ""Agency - non-credit institution"" and ""Agency - credit institution"". The broadening and renaming of the issuer group ""Corporate"" to ""Corporate and other issuers"". The list of eligible assets with the new issuer groups and asset types will be published on the ECB's website today. A snapshot file of the list of eligible assets will also be available on the ECB's website today in order to provide a clear overview of the various liquidity categories under which the assets fall. Until the revised version of the document currently entitled ""The single monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on the Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures"" is released, which is scheduled for the first quarter of 2004, counterparties will be able to find the new codes for the issuer groups and asset types and derive the corresponding liquidity category by making a query in the Eligible Assets Database on the ECB's website. Once the above-mentioned documentation has been released, the ECB will publish on its website the new liquidity category codes for tier one assets, the amended codes for tier two assets as well as the new valuation haircuts. ANNEX Following the announcement in the press release of 2 July 2003, this document provides additional information on the classification of tier one assets under the various liquidity categories. It also details the changes to the Eligible Assets Database (EAD) in terms of the allocation of issuers to certain issuer groups and liquidity categories. The new valuation haircuts will be applied upon implementation of the revised version of the document currently entitled ""The single monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures"", which is scheduled for the first quarter of 2004. Eligible tier one assets are allocated to one of four categories of decreasing liquidity based on issuer classification and asset type. All possible combinations of issuer group and asset type under the various liquidity categories are described in the table below: Liquidity categories and issuer groups for tier one assets Liquidity categories and issuer groups for tier one assets ISSUER GROUPS LIQUIDITY CATEGORY Category I Category II Category III Category IV (1) Central bank IG1 Bond (AT01); MTN (AT02); T-bill/CP/CD (AT03) - - Other securitised assets/ABS/MBS (AT11) Central government IG2 Bond (AT01); MTN (AT02); T-bill/CP/CD (AT03) - - Other securitised assets/ABS/MBS (AT11) Corporate and other issuers IG3 - - Bond (AT01); MTN (AT02); T-bill/CP/CD (AT03) Other securitised assets/ABS/MBS (AT11) Credit institution (excluding Agency -credit institution)2 IG4 - Jumbo Pfandbriefe-style (AT09) Bond (AT01); MTN (AT02); T-bill/CP/CD (AT03); Traditional Pfandbriefe-style(AT10) Other securitised assets/ABS/MBS (AT11) Regional/local government IG5 - Bond (AT01); MTN (AT02); T-bill/CP/CD (AT03) - Other securitised assets/ABS/MBS (AT11) Supranational IG6 - Bond (AT01); MTN (AT02); T-bill/CP/CD (AT03) - Other securitised assets/ABS/MBS (AT11) Agency – non-credit institution IG7 - Bond (AT01); MTN (AT02); T-bill/CP/CD (AT03) - Other securitised assets/ABS/MBS (AT11) Agency - credit institution IG8 - Bond (AT01); MTN (AT02); T-bill/CP/CD (AT03); Jumbo Pfandbriefe-style (AT09); Traditional Pfandbriefe-style(AT10) - Other securitised assets/ABS/MBS (AT11) (1) Asset-backed securities, excluding Pfandbriefe-style instruments. (2) As a result of the creation of the issuer group ""Agency - credit institution"", the issuer group ""Credit institution"" (IG4 in the EAD) has been renamed ""Credit institution (excluding Agency - credit institution""). In general, the issuer group classification determines the liquidity category. However, all asset-backed securities fall under liquidity category IV regardless of the issuer group, all Jumbo Pfandbriefe-style instruments under liquidity category II, and all other securities issued by credit institutions under liquidity category III. Counterparties will be able to identify those securities that fall under the Pfandbriefe-style instruments by making a query in the Eligible Assets Database on the ECB's website. Pfandbriefe-style instruments fall under the Jumbo Pfandbriefe-style instruments where the volume issued is no less than €500 million and where at least two market-makers provide regular bid and ask quotes. In addition to Jumbo Pfandbriefe-style instruments and securities issued by local and regional government and supranational issuers, liquidity category II includes securities issued by issuers classified as agencies by the ECB. Securities issued by other agencies fall under liquidity category III. The selection of issuers classified as agencies by the ECB will be reviewed on an annual basis. In order to clearly reflect the type of issuer and to enable the eligibility criteria to be properly implemented, a distinction between ""Agency - non-credit institution"" (IG7 in the EAD) and ""Agency - credit institution"" (IG8 in the EAD) has been introduced within the group of agencies classified under liquidity category II. The issuer group ""Corporate"" (IG3 in the EAD) has been broadened and renamed ""Corporate and other issuers"" (IG3 in the EAD). In addition to Corporate issuers, this group will include any issuers which are not specifically classified under any other issuer group. The list of eligible assets will be published on the ECB's website today. A snapshot file of the list of eligible assets will also be made available on the website today in order to provide a clear overview of the various liquidity categories under which the assets fall. Until the revised version of the document currently entitled ""The single monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on the Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures"" is released, counterparties will be able to find the new codes for the issuer groups and asset types and derive the corresponding liquidity category by making a query in the Eligible Assets Database on the ECB's website.

"451","Inflation differentials in the euro area: potential causes and policy implications","Inflation differentials in the euro area: potential causes and policy implications 30 September 2003 The European Central Bank (ECB) is today publishing a report entitled ""Inflation differentials in the euro area: potential causes and policy implications"" prepared by the Monetary Policy Committee of the European System of Central Banks, which comprises experts from the ECB and the national central banks. The report analyses the size and origins of inflation differentials in the euro area since the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union and the related policy implications. Various indicators suggest that the extent of inflation dispersion in the euro area is not notably different from that in the United States. However, in contrast to regional inflation differentials observed within the United States and individual euro area countries, most countries within the euro area have experienced relatively persistent inflation differentials since 1999. The report stresses that current inflation differentials are best explained by a combination of primarily non-structural factors, such as differences in profit margin and unit labour cost developments, in administered price and indirect tax changes, as well as in cyclical positions. In addition, some mainly structural factors, such as the impact of nominal convergence effects triggered by EMU, structural rigidities and, to a limited extent, income convergence and Balassa-Samuelson effects may have also contributed to the observed inflation differentials and their persistence. In this context, the report states that the inception of EMU implied a regime shift in monetary policy, the nominal convergence effects of which have affected the euro area countries differently and may take several years to unfold. It therefore appears still to be too early to make a final assessment of the normal inflation differentials to be expected in the euro area. The report emphasises that the single monetary policy of the ECB can only be geared towards the objective of price stability in the euro area as a whole. However, evidence suggests that inflation differentials in the past few years have been large and persistent enough to justify national remedies in some countries to prevent undue losses in competitiveness. As the single monetary policy stance, from a national perspective, is given, the report points out that national economic policies need to be adjusted to counteract such persistent and potentially damaging inflation differentials. The report will be available on the ECB's website under the ""Publications"" section. Hard copies of the report can be obtained from the ECB's Press and Information Division.

The indicative calendar is prepared in compliance with the procedures set out in the ""The Single Monetary Policy in the euro area – General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures (April 2002)"". The changes to the operational framework for monetary policy regarding the timing of the reserves maintenance period and maturity of the main refinancing operations as decided by the Governing Council on 23 January 2003 have also been taken into account in this calendar. The ECB aims at establishing conditions which ensure that counterparties in all euro area countries can participate in the main and longer-term refinancing operations. Therefore, when compiling the calendar for these operations, the ECB made the appropriate adjustments in order to take into account the bank holidays of the individual euro area countries.

This information aims at helping credit institutions to adapt to the changes to the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operational framework as decided by the Governing Council of the ECB on 23 January 2003: The timing of the reserve maintenance period will be changed so that it will always start on the settlement day of the main refinancing operation (MRO) following the Governing Council meeting at which the monthly assessment of the monetary policy stance is pre-scheduled. Furthermore, as a rule, the implementation of changes to the standing facility rates will be aligned with the start of the new reserve maintenance period. The maturity of the MROs will be shortened from two weeks to one week. It was announced at that time that these changes to the monetary policy operational framework are scheduled to come into effect during the first quarter of 2004 and that the reserve maintenance period calendar will be published at least three months in advance.

"457","New risk control framework for eligible assets","New risk control framework for eligible assets 2 July 2003 In the context of the regular assessment of the risk control framework applicable to eligible assets used in Eurosystem credit operations (i.e. intraday liquidity and monetary policy operations), the Governing Council of the ECB has approved the following changes to the risk control framework: Tier one assets are to be classified in four liquidity categories and each category assigned a specific haircut schedule. The maturity buckets of the haircut schedules are to be chosen in such a way as to achieve an even distribution of outstanding volumes across buckets. The application of initial margins in reverse transactions is to be discontinued and trigger levels used in margin calls reduced. In order to guarantee coherence between the new valuation haircut schedules for tier one eligible assets and those for tier two eligible assets, the latter are also to be modified to take into account both the discontinuation of initial margins and the new maturity buckets. The document entitled ""Amendments to the risk control framework for tier one and tier two eligible assets"" outlines the details of the amendments to the risk control framework [Publications]. The Governing Council has decided to inform counterparties of these changes to the risk control framework for tier one and tier two assets. These changes will take effect upon implementation by the national central banks, which is envisaged for the first quarter of 2004.

"459","The ECB's monetary policy strategy","The ECB's monetary policy strategy 8 May 2003 After more than four years of conducting monetary policy for the euro area, the Governing Council of the ECB has undertaken a thorough evaluation of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. This strategy, which was announced on 13 October 1998, consists of three main elements: a quantitative definition of price stability, a prominent role for money in the assessment of risks to price stability, and a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments. More than four years of implementation have worked satisfactorily. Nevertheless, the Governing Council deemed it useful to evaluate the strategy in the light of this experience, taking into account the public debate and a series of studies undertaken by staff of the Eurosystem. ""Price stability is defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term."" Today, the Governing Council confirmed this definition (which it announced in 1998). At the same time, the Governing Council agreed that in the pursuit of price stability it will aim to maintain inflation rates close to 2% over the medium term. This clarification underlines the ECB's commitment to provide a sufficient safety margin to guard against the risks of deflation. It also addresses the issue of the possible presence of a measurement bias in the HICP and the implications of inflation differentials within the euro area. The Governing Council confirmed that its monetary policy decisions will continue to be based on a comprehensive analysis of the risks to price stability. Over time, analysis under both pillars of the monetary policy strategy has been deepened and extended. This practice will be continued. However, the Governing Council wishes to clarify communication on the cross-checking of information in coming to its unified overall judgement on the risks to price stability. To this end, the introductory statement of the President will henceforth follow a new structure. It will start with the economic analysis to identify short to medium-term risks to price stability. As in the past, this will include an analysis of shocks hitting the euro area economy and projections of key macroeconomic variables. The monetary analysis will then follow to assess medium to long-term trends in inflation in view of the close relationship between money and prices over extended horizons. As in the past, monetary analysis will take into account developments in a wide range of monetary indicators including M3, its components and counterparts, notably credit, and various measures of excess liquidity. This new structure of the introductory statement will better illustrate that these two perspectives offer complementary analytical frameworks to support the Governing Council's overall assessment of risks to price stability. In this respect, the monetary analysis mainly serves as a means of cross-checking, from a medium to long-term perspective, the short to medium-term indications coming from economic analysis. To underscore the longer-term nature of the reference value for monetary growth as a benchmark for the assessment of monetary developments, the Governing Council also decided to no longer conduct a review of the reference value on an annual basis. However, it will continue to assess the underlying conditions and assumptions. The ECB will today publish on its website a number of background studies prepared by its staff which, together with papers published earlier, served as input into the Governing Council's reflections on the ECB's monetary policy strategy.

"466","Measures to improve the efficiency of the operational framework for monetary policy","Measures to improve the efficiency of the operational framework for monetary policy 23 January 2003 The Governing Council of the ECB has decided to implement the following two measures to improve the operational framework for monetary policy: The timing of the reserve maintenance period will be changed so that it will always start on the settlement day of the main refinancing operation (MRO) following the Governing Council meeting at which the monthly assessment of the monetary policy stance is pre-scheduled.* Furthermore, as a rule, the implementation of changes to the standing facility rates will be aligned with the start of the new reserve maintenance period. The maturity of the MROs will be shortened from two weeks to one week. The combination of the two measures will help remove expectations of interest rate changes during any particular maintenance period, given that changes in the ECB's key interest rates will only apply, in general, to the forthcoming reserve maintenance period and that liquidity conditions will no longer spill over from one reserve maintenance period to the next. Hence, the measures will contribute to stabilising the conditions in which bidding in the MROs takes place. They will also ensure that the reserve maintenance period always starts on a TARGET operating day, while ending on a non-TARGET day will be very rare. Given the preparatory work required for the implementation of these measures, they are scheduled to come into effect during the first quarter of 2004. The reserve maintenance period calendar will be published at least three months in advance. Under the new system, the gap between the date on which the reserve base is calculated, i.e. the last day of a month, and the start of the reserve maintenance period will be at least as long as it is at present. For instance, a credit institution's reserve requirement for a maintenance period starting in April would be calculated using its reserve base data from end of February. On 7 October 2002 the Eurosystem launched a public consultation to gather the views of market participants on a set of planned technical measures designed to improve the efficiency of the operational framework for monetary policy. Besides the two measures now decided, market participants' views were also requested regarding the possible suspension of the longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs). Since these operations appear to continue to serve the liquidity management needs of the Eurosystem's counterparties, the Governing Council of the ECB decided not to suspend them. The Eurosystem received a strong response to this public consultation, highly representative of the euro area banking community, in terms of both geographical location and institution size. Comments were received from 17 banking and financial market associations (five pan-European associations and 12 national associations representing eight countries). There were also 42 replies from individual credit institutions, including both large EONIA panel banks and small institutions. On the whole, the public consultation was received very favourably by market participants and it produced valuable additional input with regard to the planned changes. A summary of the comments received is available in the public consultation sections of the ECB's and the national central banks' websites. * On 8 November 2001 it was announced that the Governing Council of the ECB would assess its monetary policy stance, as a rule, only at its first meeting of each month. The exact schedule of the monthly meetings is published by the ECB around mid-year for the following year.

"469","Review of the quantitative reference value for monetary growth","Review of the quantitative reference value for monetary growth 5 December 2002 Review of the reference value At its meeting on 5 December 2002 the Governing Council reviewed the reference value for monetary growth. It decided to reconfirm the existing value, namely an annual growth rate of 4½% for the broad aggregate M3. This decision was taken on the grounds that the current evidence continues to support the assumptions underlying the first derivation of the reference value in December 1998, namely those for trend potential growth in the range of 2–2½% per annum and for a trend decline in M3 income velocity of ½–1% per annum in the euro area. With regard to the assumption of trend potential growth, the Governing Council considers that there is no evidence that structural changes have taken place in the euro area which would warrant a revision of this assumption underlying the reference value. The attainment of higher potential growth in the euro area, which is urgently needed, remains conditional on further progress in structural reforms, especially in the labour and goods markets. Against this background, the Governing Council will continue to monitor the evidence with regard to developments in productivity growth in the euro area, and the ECB's monetary policy will take such evidence into account as appropriate. With regard to the assumption for the trend in M3 income velocity, the available evidence confirms that it continues to be valid. The Governing Council will undertake the next review of the reference value in December 2003. Background: the ECB's monetary policy strategy and the reference value The Governing Council wishes to recall the following features of the reference value and its role in the ECB's monetary policy strategy. Under its first pillar, the monetary policy strategy of the ECB assigns a prominent role to money in reflection of the fundamentally monetary origins of inflation over the medium to longer-term horizons. The close association between money and prices over the medium term, one of the fundamental principles in economics, suggests that the analysis of persistent trends in money is crucial for any central bank aiming at maintaining price stability. Exploiting the information content in monetary and credit aggregates helps the central bank to look beyond the transitory impact of various shocks and to maintain a medium-term orientation in monetary policy. This also matches the Governing Council's experience that since the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union the analysis of monetary developments in general, and of M3 in particular, has provided very useful input for assessing the economic situation and taking monetary policy decisions. Moreover, historical experience shows that episodes of asset price overvaluations have tended to be accompanied by strong money and credit growth. The analysis of monetary and credit aggregates can help to identify the build-up of financial imbalances which may in turn have implications for price stability. In order to signal this prominent role of money to the public, in October 1998 the Governing Council decided to announce a reference value for the growth rate of a broad monetary aggregate. In December 1998, the Governing Council announced the first reference value of 4½% for the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3. Several studies have provided empirical evidence confirming that the condition for announcing a reference value, namely the stability of money demand, is satisfied for the euro area. Furthermore, studies have shown that M3 has good leading indicator properties for future price developments over medium-term horizons. The reference value is derived in a way that is consistent with – and serves the achievement of – price stability. The derivation of the reference value is, therefore, based on the ECB's definition of price stability as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. To be consistent with the medium-term orientation of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, the reference value is derived using the assumptions for the medium-term trend in M3 income velocity and trend potential growth. At its meeting on 5 December 2002, the Governing Council reassessed and confirmed the assumptions underlying the derivation of the reference value, namely that over the medium term: M3 income velocity declines at a trend rate in the range of ½% to 1% per annum, and potential output grows at a trend rate between 2% and 2½% per annum. Taking account of the definition of price stability and these last two assumptions, the Governing Council decided to reconfirm the existing reference value for monetary growth, namely an annual growth rate of M3 of 4½%. The Governing Council will continue to monitor monetary developments in relation to the reference value on the basis of a three-month moving average of annual growth rates and continue to focus its assessment of the liquidity conditions in the euro area on the analysis of the persistent deviations from the reference value and of the underlying reasons for such deviations. The Governing Council wishes to stress that the reference value for monetary growth is a medium-term concept which is based on medium-term assumptions for the development of its fundamental determinants. In general, short-run movements in money may be difficult to interpret and may stem from a number of temporary factors which do not necessarily have implications for future price developments. For this reason, the Governing Council already made it clear in 1998 that the announcement of the reference value does not entail a commitment on the part of the ECB to correct mechanistically deviations of monetary growth from the reference value. Rather, the reference value, by making explicit what is the rate of growth of money that is considered to be consistent with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, is a key tool for monetary analysis. It provides monetary policy with a ""compass"" which ensures that the central bank, while responding to the variety of shocks affecting the economy over time, does not lose sight of the fact that over a sufficiently extended period of time the rate of growth of money must be consistent with its price stability objective. The analysis of the deviations of annual M3 growth from the reference value represents an important element in the evaluation of monetary developments and their implications for future price stability. However, monetary analysis is not limited to this evaluation. Other monetary indicators (such as M1 and loans to the private sector) also contain significant information. Furthermore, it is important to take into account past deviations of M3 growth from the reference value, in order to come to a broadly based assessment of the liquidity conditions in the euro area. Finally, developments in M3 need to be analysed in conjunction with other, non-monetary indicators (e.g. GDP, prices, interest rates and other financial market indicators) in order to understand the nature of the shocks affecting monetary developments and to extract best the indications for future price developments. Against this background, the experience of high M3 growth over the past one and a half years has to be assessed in the context of large portfolio re-allocations by the euro area non-MFI private sector triggered by the high level of uncertainty and distress in financial markets and notably by the unprecedented decline in stock prices over the past two years. These exceptional developments have prompted non-MFI residents in the euro area to reduce their holdings of relatively risky assets such as shares and increase their demand for relatively liquid and low-risk assets included in M3. The protracted phase of financial uncertainty has caused some signs of instability in the short-term dynamics of M3 in recent periods, as captured by available money demand models for the euro area. However, the reference value is a medium-term concept and should therefore not be assessed on the basis of short periods of time. In this respect, given the exceptional nature of recent stock market developments in terms of their size and duration, events such as those of the past two years would not be expected to occur regularly. In addition, and more importantly, there are at present no signs of structural breaks or changes in the long-run fundamental relationship between money and prices in the euro area which underlies the derivation of the reference value. Nevertheless, it will be necessary in the future to continue to monitor closely the stability of this long-run relationship in the euro area. Owing to the current economic and financial market uncertainty, the interpretation of monetary developments is at present more difficult than under normal circumstances. In particular, it is uncertain when a normalisation of the situation in financial markets will occur. At the current juncture, the protracted strong monetary dynamics, which are also reinforced by the low opportunity cost of holding money, have led to an accumulation of substantial liquidity in the euro area. Given the current circumstances of relatively weak economic activity, this situation is not seen as signalling risks to price stability in the near future. The Governing Council also wishes to recall that the ECB's monetary policy strategy uses two pillars in order to assess the risks to future price stability. The monetary analysis always has to be seen in conjunction with the second pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, which uses other economic and financial indicators for the evaluation of the risks to price stability. This diversified approach to the analysis stimulates the cross-checking of information, thereby reducing the risks of policy-related mistakes in an uncertain environment.

"484","New ECB Regulation in the field of minimum reserves","New ECB Regulation in the field of minimum reserves 23 April 2002 At its meeting on 18 April 2002, the Governing Council of the ECB approved a new Regulation on the application of minimum reserves, which amends the Regulation of 1 December 1998 (ECB/1998/15). The main aim of the new Regulation is to clarify a number of issues with regard to minimum reserves. According to the new Regulation, electronic money institutions will be subject to minimum reserve requirements. The Regulation further introduces the automatic exemption of institutions from minimum reserve requirements in the event that their licence has been withdrawn or renounced, as well as in the event that they are subject to winding-up proceedings. This automatic exemption is considered adequate for reasons of administrative efficiency. Finally, the formula concerning the calculation of the remuneration of holdings of required reserves has been adjusted owing to the possibility of more than one main refinancing operation being settled on the same day (which may be the case under a ""split tender"", for instance). The Regulation was published today in the Official Journal of the European Communities and is available on the ECB's website. It will enter into force on 24 May 2002.

"490","Review of the quantitative reference value for monetary growth","Review of the quantitative reference value for monetary growth 6 December 2001 Review of the reference value At its meeting on 6 December 2001 the Governing Council reviewed the reference value for monetary growth. It decided to reconfirm the existing reference value for monetary growth, namely an annual growth rate of 4½% for the broad aggregate M3. This decision was taken on the grounds that the evidence continues to support the assumptions underlying the first derivation of the reference value in December 1998, namely those for trend potential output growth of 2-2½% and for a trend decline in M3 income velocity of ½-1% per annum in the euro area. With regard to the assumption of trend potential output growth, the Governing Council considers that there is still no decisive evidence of measurable and lasting increases in productivity growth in the euro area that would warrant an upward revision to this assumption. The Governing Council believes that the potential upward impact on trend output growth from structural reforms and technological innovation could be large. However, while some progress has been made in the field of structural reform, significant further steps ­ especially in the labour and goods markets ­ need to be taken in order to achieve a permanent and significant increase in potential output growth in the euro area. Against this background, the Governing Council will continue to monitor the evidence with regard to developments in productivity growth in the euro area, and the ECB's monetary policy will take such evidence into account as appropriate. The Governing Council will undertake the next review of the reference value in December 2002. The ECB's monetary policy strategy and the reference value The Governing Council wishes to recall the following features of the reference value and its role in the ECB's monetary policy strategy. Under its first pillar, the monetary policy strategy of the ECB assigns a prominent role to money. To signal the prominent role of money to the public, the Governing Council decided in October 1998 to announce a quantitative reference value for the growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3. Several studies have provided empirical evidence in support of this role and confirm that the conditions for announcing a reference value are satisfied for the euro area. The official series of M3 (which is now adjusted for all non-euro area residents' holdings of negotiable instruments) exhibits all the desired properties, i.e. a stable money demand relationship and good leading indicator properties for future price developments at medium-term horizons. This evidence also matches the Governing Council's experience that since the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union the analysis of monetary developments has provided very useful information for monetary policy decisions. To be consistent with the medium-term relationship between money and prices, the reference value is derived using assumptions for the medium-term trends in M3 income velocity and potential output growth. At its meeting on 6 December 2001, the Governing Council reassessed and confirmed the assumptions underlying the derivation of the reference value, namely that over the medium term: a) M3 income velocity declines at a trend rate in the range from ½% to 1% per annum; and b) potential output grows at a trend rate between 2% and 2½% per annum. Taking account of the definition of price stability and these two assumptions, the Governing Council decided to reconfirm the existing reference value for monetary growth, namely an annual growth rate of 4½% for M3. Furthermore, the Governing Council will continue to monitor monetary developments in relation to the reference value on the basis of a three- month moving average of annual growth rates. The reference value for monetary growth is a medium-term concept. Short-run movements in M3 may stem from a number of temporary factors and do not necessarily have implications for future price developments. For this reason the Governing Council already made it clear in 1998 that the announcement of the reference value does not entail a commitment on the part of the ECB to correct mechanistically deviations of monetary growth from the reference value. Rather, developments in M3 are thoroughly analysed by the ECB, in conjunction with other indicators, in order to ascertain their implications for the risks to price stability over the medium term. The analysis of the deviations of annual M3 growth from the reference value represents an important element in the evaluation of monetary developments and the implications for future price stability. However, monetary analysis is not limited to this evaluation. Other monetary indicators (such as components and counterparts of M3, in particular loans) also contain significant information. Furthermore, it is important to take into account past deviations from the reference value which have dropped out of annual growth rates, in order to come to a broadly based assessment of the liquidity conditions in the euro area. Finally, developments in M3 need to be analysed in conjunction with other, non-monetary indicators (e.g. GDP, prices, interest rates and other financial market indicators) in order to understand the nature of the shocks affecting monetary developments and to extract best the indications for future price developments. The relatively high growth rate of M3 observed over the past few months should be assessed in the light of the above considerations. The recent pick-up in the rate of growth of M3 can be explained partly as an adjustment of M3 following a sharp increase in the price level resulting from the oil and food price shocks in the euro area and partly as a consequence of the effects of portfolio shifts. These shifts were initially triggered by a relatively flat yield curve and developments in stock markets, and, more recently, by a surge in financial market uncertainty in the aftermath of the events of 11 September. Taking into account also the continuing decline in the growth of credit to the private sector, the Governing Council has made it clear that it does not see any risks to price stability in the medium term arising from recent monetary developments. Owing to the current economic and financial market uncertainty, the interpretation of monetary developments in the near future is likely to be more difficult than under normal circumstances ­ as is true for other indicators ­ and these developments should therefore be assessed with caution. Should, however, the current economic and financial market uncertainties subside, any persisting excess liquidity in the economy should be carefully reassessed with respect to whether it signals risks to future price stability. The Governing Council also wishes to recall that the ECB's monetary policy strategy uses two pillars in order to assess the risks to future price stability. The monetary analysis always has to be seen in conjunction with the second pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, which uses other economic and financial indicators for the evaluation of the risks to price stability. This diversified approach to the analysis stimulates the cross-checking of information and takes into account various interpretations of this information, thereby reducing the risks of policy-related mistakes in an uncertain environment.

"496","Monetary policy decisions","Monetary policy decisions 17 September 2001 Following the terrorist attacks on the US, uncertainty about the US and the world economy has increased. The Federal Open Market Committee has reacted by lowering its target for the federal funds rate today. In concert with this decision, the Governing Council of the ECB met today by means of teleconferencing and took the following monetary policy decisions: The minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be reduced by 0.50 percentage point to 3.75%. Differently from what was communicated in an announcement at 3.30 p.m. today, this change in the minimum bid rate will be effective starting from tomorrow's operation, which is to be settled on 19 September 2001. A new announcement with the revised rates is also being transmitted through wire services. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be reduced by 0.50 percentage point to 4.75%, with effect from 18 September 2001. The interest rate on the deposit facility will be reduced by 0.50 percentage point to 2.75%, with effect from 18 September 2001. In the view of the Governing Council, the recent events in the US are likely to weigh adversely on confidence in the euro area, reducing the short-term outlook for domestic growth. As this is likely to further reduce inflationary risks in the euro area, a lowering of the ECB's key interest rates is appropriate. The Governing Council has confidence in the fundamental strength and resilience of the US economic system. Against the background of the sound fundamentals of the euro area, the Governing Council remains confident that the slowdown in economic growth will be short-lived.

"518","President's summing up of the position of the Governing Council","President's summing up of the position of the Governing Council 30 March 2001 The European Central Bank (ECB) confirms its position of 'wait and see' with regard to its monetary policy stance. In an environment of increased uncertainty about the global economy and its impact on the euro area, the Governing Council is carefully assessing whether and to what extent upward risks to price stability will continue to decline. The ECB has the primary objective of maintaining price stability. Within its forward-looking strategy, the Governing Council has raised central bank interest rates to contain increasing inflation risks and to bring inflation back to levels below 2 % over the medium term. This policy has retained credibility as demonstrated by continuing low inflation expectations. It is important for economic growth that the households of the euro area can rely on price stability preserving their purchasing power and, therefore, supporting solid domestic demand. Information from the first pillar shows that money growth has been on a downward trend since the spring of 2000, indicating that upward risks to price stability from the monetary side have receded. As for the second pillar, somewhat lower real GDP growth this year will contribute to a reduction in domestic upward price pressures. On the other hand, owing to the risk of second-round effects from past oil price increases, wage developments need to be monitored carefully. This statement was distributed today by Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet and Mr. Ernst Welteke on the occasion of a joint press conference during the French/German Finance Meeting in Rouen, France.

"529","Review of the quantitative reference value for monetary growth","Review of the quantitative reference value for monetary growth 14 December 2000 Review of the reference value At its meeting on 14 December 2000 the Governing Council reviewed the reference value for monetary growth. The Governing Council decided to reconfirm the existing reference value for monetary growth, namely an annual growth rate of 4 1/2% for the broad aggregate M3. This decision was taken on the grounds that the evidence continues to support the assumptions underlying the derivation of the first reference value in December 1998 (and its confirmation in December 1999), namely those for trend potential output growth and the trend decline in M3 income velocity in the euro area. As regards the assumption for trend potential output growth, the Governing Council acknowledged that progress has been made in the euro area in the field of structural reforms. However, there is still no decisive evidence that measurable and lasting increases in productivity growth in the euro area would warrant a significant upward revision in the assumption for trend potential GDP growth. This notwithstanding, the uncertainties surrounding estimates of medium-term development of potential output growth in the euro area have become skewed to the upside. Against this background, the Governing Council will carefully monitor further evidence with regard to an acceleration of productivity growth in the euro area. The Governing Council also wishes to emphasise that potential output growth could be strengthened by further structural reforms in the labour and goods markets. Naturally, the ECB's monetary policy would take such changes appropriately into account. The reconfirmation of the reference value implies the continuation of the pursuit of the monetary policy strategy conducted in the past. The Governing Council will undertake the next review of the reference value in December 2001. The ECB's monetary policy strategy and the reference value In the context of the review of the reference value, the Governing Council wishes to recall the following features of the reference value and its role in the ECB's monetary policy strategy. 1. Under its first pillar, the monetary policy strategy of the ECB assigns a prominent role to money. To signal the prominent role of money to the public, in October 1998 the Governing Council decided to announce a quantitative reference value for the growth rate of a broad monetary aggregate. In December 1998, the Governing Council announced the first reference value of 4 1/2% for annual growth of the monetary aggregate M3. Several studies have provided empirical evidence in support of this role and confirm that the conditions for announcing a reference value (stable money demand relationship and leading indicator properties of M3 for future inflation) are satisfied for the euro area. 2. The reference value was derived using the well-known relationship between monetary growth, on the one hand, and developments in prices, real GDP and the income velocity of circulation, on the other. A reference value derived in this way is consistent with - and serves the achievement of - price stability. The derivation of the reference value was therefore based on the Eurosystem's definition of price stability. The Eurosystem defines price stability as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term. To be consistent with the medium-term orientation of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, the reference value was derived using assumptions for the trend of M3 income velocity over the medium-term and the medium-term trend of potential output growth. The assumptions were: Over the medium term, M3 income velocity declines at a trend rate in the range from 1/2% to 1% per annum. Potential output grows at a trend rate between 2% and 2 1/2% per annum over the medium term. Taking account of the definition of price stability and these two assumptions, the Governing Council decided in December 1998 to set the first reference value at 4 1/2% and confirmed this value in December 1999 on the grounds of unchanged medium-term assumptions. 3. At its meeting on 14 December 2000, the Governing Council reviewed these assumptions and concluded that both of them remain valid in principle. The Governing Council therefore confirmed the reference value at 4 1/2%. 4. The Governing Council also wishes to recall that the ECB's monetary policy strategy uses two pillars in order to assess the risks to future price stability. The monetary analysis always has to be seen in conjunction with the second pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, which uses other economic and financial indicators in the context of a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability. The reference value does not entail a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to correct mechanistically deviations of monetary growth from the reference value. Rather, monetary developments are thoroughly analysed, in conjunction with other indicators in order to ascertain their implications for the risks to price stability over the medium term.

"538","Sales of foreign exchange interest income by the European Central Bank (ECB)","Sales of foreign exchange interest income by the European Central Bank (ECB) 14 September 2000 At the beginning of 1999 the ECB was provided with foreign reserve assets with a market value, at that time, of some EUR 39.5 billion, 15% of which was gold. These assets were transferred to the ECB by the national central banks of the Eurosystem in accordance with Article 30 of the Statute of the ESCB. The foreign currency component of the ECB's foreign reserve assets has been invested, and it earns foreign exchange revenue for the ECB. The ECB's holdings of foreign currencies have increased by an amount corresponding to over EUR 2.5 billion since the beginning of 1999, mainly on account of receipts of interest income, denominated primarily in US dollars but also in Japanese yen. The Governing Council of the ECB decided at its meeting on 31 August 2000 that inflows derived from the interest income of the foreign reserve assets would be sold against euro in order to maintain the structure and risk profile of the ECB's balance sheet as it was at the beginning of 1999. The sale of the interest income accrued so far will start today and will be spread over a number of days. After this initial sale, it is intended that future inflows will normally be sold on a regular basis. The amounts actually sold will be indicated in the ECB's commentary on the consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem, published on a weekly basis. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of Japan have been informed of these planned foreign exchange operations.

By releasing the indicative calendar at this early stage, the ECB aims to create the conditions to facilitate the participation of counterparties throughout the euro area in the main and the longer-term refinancing operations.

"541","Monetary policy decisions","Monetary policy decisions 31 August 2000 At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions: The minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 4.50%, starting from the operation to be settled on 6 September 2000. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 5.50%, with effect from 1 September 2000. The interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 3.50%, with effect from 1 September 2000. The Governing Council is of the view that economic growth conditions and prospects in the euro area are very favourable. In order to maintain this benign environment, price stability over the medium term must be ensured. While present conditions are largely influenced by oil price and exchange rate developments and cannot be remedied by monetary policy in the short term, it is imperative that medium-term upward pressure on prices be contained. Today's policy decisions support the favourable prospects for high economic growth in the euro area. In the context of the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, although the measures taken since November 1999 are gradually feeding their way through, the latest available information indicates that M3 growth has continued to deviate on the upside from the reference value of 4½%. At the same time, the expansion of credit to the private sector, at around 10%, suggests that households and firms regard financing conditions in the euro area as being very favourable. In the context of the robust expansion of economic activity, a continuation of ample liquidity conditions would constitute a risk to price stability. Developments in key indicators related to the second pillar point in the same direction. The protracted depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro and the renewed rise in oil prices have increasingly put upward pressure on import prices and consumer prices in the euro area. At the same time, recent data have confirmed that the euro area has entered a period of strong growth and that the outlook remains very positive. The Governing Council will continue to ensure that price stability is maintained in the euro area and will remain alert to all emerging risks to price stability. At the same time, it stresses that both sound public finances, in particular strict adherence to the criteria laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact, and the continuation of structural measures to enhance the flexibility of labour and goods markets will be the key to a lasting increase in the growth potential of the euro area.

As announced on 8 June 2000, the forthcoming main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be conducted as variable rate tenders, applying the multiple rate auction procedure, with a minimum bid rate of 4.25%. This rate is the same as that which prevailed for the two fixed rate tender operations settled on 15 and 21 June 2000. The Governing Council also decided that, for the longer-term refinancing operations to be conducted in the second half of 2000, the Eurosystem intends to allot an amount of EUR 15 billion per operation. This amount takes into consideration the expected liquidity needs of the banking system of the euro area in the second half of 2000 and the desire of the Eurosystem to continue to provide the bulk of its refinancing of the financial sector through its main refinancing operations.

"546","Switch to variable rate tenders in main refinancing operations: some technical details","Switch to variable rate tenders in main refinancing operations: some technical details 16 June 2000 At its meeting on 8 June 2000 the Governing Council of the ECB decided that, starting from the operation to be settled on 28 June 2000, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be conducted as variable rate tenders, using the multiple rate auction procedure. Furthermore, the Governing Council decided to set a minimum bid rate of 4.25% for these operations. As was clarified when the decision was communicated following the meeting of the Governing Council, the switch to variable rate tenders in the main refinancing operations is not intended as a further change in the monetary policy stance of the Eurosystem. The new tender mechanism is a response to the severe overbidding which has developed in the context of the current fixed rate tender procedure. For the purpose of signalling the monetary policy stance, the minimum bid rate is designed to play the role performed, until now, by the rate in fixed rate tenders. The main features of the variable rate tender procedure in main refinancing operations are as follows: The timetable for the tender announcement, the allotment decision and the announcement of the results will be the same as that for a main refinancing operation conducted as a fixed rate tender. The tender will be conducted as a multiple rate (""American"") auction, i.e. an auction at which the allotment interest rate equals the interest rate offered in each individual bid. This is the same as the type of auction applied since March 1999 in the longer-term refinancing operations. The tender announcement will include, in addition to the standard information, the minimum bid rate and an indication of the expected liquidity needs of the banking system. This indication refers to an average for the period from the day of announcement until (and including) the day before the settlement of the following main refinancing operation. If this time interval goes beyond the end of a reserve maintenance period, an estimate of the average liquidity needs until the end of the reserve maintenance period will also be provided. An estimate of the liquidity needs of the banking system is necessarily surrounded by a significant degree of uncertainty. The ECB provides its estimates to the best of its knowledge at the time of publication, drawing from the information provided by national central banks. It should also be stressed that the ECB bases its allotment decisions on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the expected liquidity needs of the banking system. The liquidity needs are defined as the average, over the relevant period, of the daily sum of reserve requirements and of all factors other than monetary policy operations of the Eurosystem which affect the banking system's liquidity (the so-called autonomous factors, e.g. banknotes and government deposits with the Eurosystem; see the box in each issue of the ECB Monthly Bulletin entitled ""Monetary policy operations and liquidity conditions in the reserve maintenance period ending on ..."", for instance pages 18 to 19 in the June 2000 issue). The ECB pages providing daily information on liquidity conditions will display ex post data on liquidity factors other than monetary policy operations, to allow counterparties easily to assess the deviation of actual figures from the published estimates. The announcement of the tender results will include the total amount allotted, the minimum bid rate, the marginal interest rate, the weighted average allotment rate and the percentage of allotment at the marginal rate. Eligible counterparties may submit bids for up to ten different interest rate levels. In each bid they state the amount they are willing to transact with the national central banks and the respective interest rate. The interest rates bid must be expressed as multiples of 0.01 percentage point. Bids at a rate below the minimum bid rate announced by the ECB will be discarded. The minimum bid amount is EUR 1,000,000. This means that each bid at a certain percentage point must at least be equal to this amount. Bids exceeding the minimum bid amount must be expressed as multiples of EUR 100,000. In the allotment by the ECB, bids are listed from the highest to the lowest offered interest rate. Bids with the highest interest rate levels will be satisfied first and bids with successively lower interest rates will be accepted until the total liquidity to be allotted is exhausted. If, at the lowest interest rate level accepted (i.e. the marginal interest rate), the aggregate amount bid exceeds the amount still to be allotted, this will be allocated pro rata among the bids. Finally, it should be recalled that the remuneration of required reserves corresponds to the average of the marginal rates applied in the main refinancing operations over the reserve maintenance period and that other technical details of the Eurosystem's tender procedures in open market operations are provided in the document entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"", which is available on the ECB's website (http://www.ecb.europa.eu).

"547","Monetary policy decisions","Monetary policy decisions 8 June 2000 At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions: The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to 4.25% and applied in the two operations (which will be conducted as fixed rate tenders) to be settled on 15 and 21 June 2000. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to 5.25% with effect from 9 June 2000. The interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to 3.25%, with effect from 9 June 2000. Starting from the operation to be settled on 28 June 2000, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be conducted as variable rate tenders, applying the multiple rate auction procedure. The Governing Council has decided to set a minimum bid rate for these operations equal to 4.25%. This is the same rate as that which will prevail for the two fixed rate tenders to be implemented following today's decision. The switch to variable rate tenders in the main refinancing operations is not intended as a further change in the monetary policy stance of the Eurosystem. The new tender mechanism is a response to the severe overbidding which has developed in the context of the current fixed rate tender procedure. For the purpose of signalling the monetary policy stance, the minimum bid rate is designed to play the role performed, until now, by the rate in fixed rate tenders. This change does not in any way rule out the option that, in the future, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem may be conducted in principle as fixed rate tenders. The time available until implementation of the new tender procedure as from the first main refinancing operation of the maintenance period starting on 24 June 2000 will help counterparties to prepare for the change. In accordance with Article 8 of the Regulation (EC) No. 2818/98 of the European Central Bank of 1 December 1998 on the application of minimum reserves (ECB/1998/15), the marginal interest rate of the main refinancing operation is used to calculate the remuneration of required reserves.

"550","Monetary policy decisions","Monetary policy decisions 27 April 2000 Following the regular examination of the outlook for price developments in the euro area on the basis of the latest information on monetary, financial and other economic developments, the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions at today's meeting: The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 3.75%, starting from the operation to be settled on 4 May 2000. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 4.75%, with effect from 28 April 2000. The interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 2.75%, with effect from 28 April 2000. With today's decision, the Governing Council of the ECB continues its policy of reacting to upside risks to price stability in the medium term in a pre-emptive manner. In this way, monetary policy provides the best contribution to ensuring the sustainability of the current phase of strong and non-inflationary economic growth. In its discussions the Governing Council confirmed the assessment which was presented by the President of the ECB in his introductory statement at the press conference after the Governing Council meeting on 13 April, as well as in the following issue of the ECB Monthly Bulletin. In particular, the Governing Council expressed concern about upside risks to price stability which, given the prospects for strong economic expansion, arise from strong growth in monetary and credit aggregates, as well as from the present level of the exchange rate of the euro. The Governing Council discussed recent movements in the exchange rates between the major currencies, including the recent decline of the euro, and examined their possible implications for price stability in the euro area. The ECB judges that the present level of the euro does not reflect the strong economic fundamentals of the euro area.

"553","Monetary policy decisions","Monetary policy decisions 16 March 2000 At today's meeting (which was also attended by the President of the European Commission, Mr. R. Prodi) the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions: The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 3.5%, starting from the operation to be settled on 22 March 2000. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 4.5%, with effect from 17 March 2000. The interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 2.5%, with effect from 17 March 2000. Following the regular examination of the outlook for price developments in the euro area on the basis of the latest information on monetary, financial and other economic developments, the Governing Council confirmed the assessment which was presented by the President of the ECB in his introductory statement at the press conference after the Governing Council meeting on 2 March 2000, as well as in the following issue of the ECB Monthly Bulletin. As noted there, economic conditions and prospects for the euro area appear to be better at present than at any time in the past decade. At the same time, upside risks to price stability were seen as a reason for vigilance. Today's decision addresses these upside risks, thereby contributing to maintaining the favourable outlook for the euro area economy. With regard to the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, the prolonged deviation of M3 growth from the reference value of 4 1/2% points to the existence of ample liquidity in the euro area, especially when seen in conjunction with the continued strong growth of credit granted to the private sector. Considering the second pillar, most indicators and forecasts point to increasing upward pressures on consumer price inflation over the medium term. The strong rise in oil prices and the downward movement of the exchange rate of the euro in the past are putting upward pressure on import costs and producer prices. In the context of a strong cyclical upswing, there is a risk that these developments could, via second round effects, have lasting effects on consumer price inflation. Today's increase in ECB interest rates follows the interest rate decisions taken on 4 November 1999 and 3 February 2000 and continues the policy of countering these emerging upside risks to price stability in a timely and pre-emptive manner. By ensuring a non-inflationary environment, this move will contribute to ensuring sustainable economic growth in the euro area.

"559","The Eurosystem will conduct a liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operation on 5 January 2000","The Eurosystem will conduct a liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operation on 5 January 2000 4 January 2000 The ECB has decided to conduct a liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operation on 5 January 2000, with same day settlement and maturity on 12 January 2000. The operation will be specified as a collection of fixed-term deposits and will be processed as a quick tender procedure with a variable rate. Bids at an interest rate up to a maximum of 3.00% will be accepted for submission. The intended allotment volume, which will be specified tomorrow in the tender announcement to be issued at 11 a.m., will be around EUR 35 billion. Counterparties selected for fine-tuning operations will be invited to participate. The prevailing liquidity situation reflects the ECB's commitment to prevent liquidity constraints from occurring during the transition to the year 2000, as well as the substantial expansion of liquidity provided by autonomous factors at the beginning of the year. As the transition to the year 2000 went smoothly, the ECB now considers it appropriate to adjust the liquidity situation accordingly. This decision takes into account the fact that the next main refinancing operation will not take place until 12 January 2000, as the ECB decided in September 1999 to eliminate, on prudence grounds, the maturing and renewal of main refinancing operations during the first week of this year.

"561","Minimum reserve system revision of the standardised deduction from the reserve base","Minimum reserve system revision of the standardised deduction from the reserve base 2 December 1999 In the minimum reserve system of the Eurosystem, the liabilities which a credit institution owes to other institutions subject to this system (the ""interbank liabilities"") are excluded from the reserve base. The general criterion for the application of this provision is that credit institutions have to provide evidence of their interbank liabilities. However, if a credit institution cannot provide evidence of its interbank liabilities in the form of debt securities issued with an agreed maturity of up to two years or money market paper, the European Central Bank (ECB) allows the institution to apply a standardised deduction to the aforementioned liabilities (see Article 3.2 of the Regulation (EC) No. 2818/98 of the European Central Bank of 1 December 1998 on the application of minimum reserves (ECB/1998/15)). At its meeting on 2 December 1999 the Governing Council of the ECB decided, after a review of new statistical evidence available, to increase from 10% to 30% the standardised deduction from the reserve base to be applied to debt securities issued with an agreed maturity of up to two years and money market paper. This decision shall have effect as from the determination of the reserve requirement to be fulfilled in the maintenance period starting on 24 January 2000.

"562","Review of the quantitative reference value for monetary growth","Review of the quantitative reference value for monetary growth 2 December 1999 At its meeting on 2 December 1999 the Governing Council decided to confirm the reference value for monetary growth, namely an annual growth rate of 4½% for the broad aggregate M3. This decision was taken on the grounds that the components underlying the derivation of the first reference value in December 1998, namely the Eurosystem's definition of price stability and the assumptions for trend real GDP growth and the trend decline in M3 income velocity, have remained unchanged. As before, the Governing Council will assess monetary developments in relation to the reference value on the basis of a three-month moving average of annual growth rates. The Governing Council has decided henceforth to review the reference value on a regular annual basis, with the next review to take place in December 2000. Against this background, the Governing Council wishes to emphasise that the trend growth potential of the euro area could be considerably enhanced by structural reform in the labour and goods markets. The Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy would take such changes into account, as appropriate. The derivation of the reference value of 4½% is an expression of a medium-term-oriented approach. The generous liquidity situation in 1999 will have to be borne in mind. In the context of the review of the reference value, the Governing Council wishes to recall the following features of the reference value and its role in the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem: Given the monetary origins of inflation over the longer term, the Governing Council assigns a prominent role to money. This is the ""first pillar"" of the Eurosystem's stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. To signal the prominent role of money to the public, in October 1998 the Governing Council decided to announce a quantitative reference value for the growth rate of a broad monetary aggregate. In December 1998 the Governing Council announced the first reference value of 4½% annual growth for the monetary aggregate M3. The first reference value was derived using the well-known relationship between monetary growth, on the one hand, and developments in prices, real GDP and the income velocity of circulation, on the other. The reference value was derived so as to be consistent with - and serve the achievement of - price stability. It was therefore based on the Eurosystem's definition of price stability. The Eurosystem defines price stability as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term. To be consistent with the medium-term orientation of the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy, the reference value was derived using assumptions for the medium-term trend in real GDP and the evolution of M3 income velocity over the medium term. The assumptions were: real GDP grows at a trend rate of between 2% and 2½% per annum over the medium term and M3 income velocity declines at a trend rate in the range from ½% to 1% per annum over the medium term. Taking account of the definition of price stability and these two assumptions, the Governing Council decided in December 1998 to set the first reference value at 4½%. At its meeting on 2 December 1999 the Governing Council reviewed these assumptions and confirmed that both of them remain valid. The Governing Council therefore saw no reason to change the reference value. The Governing Council also took the opportunity of this review to re-emphasise that the concept of a reference value is embedded in a monetary policy strategy which is aimed at the maintenance of price stability. The strategy uses two pillars in order to assess the risks to future price stability. The reference value for monetary growth is an important part of the first pillar of the strategy, which assigns a prominent role to the analysis of monetary developments. The information revealed by this analysis has always to be seen in conjunction with the second pillar of the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy, which includes a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability, using other available indicators. The reference value therefore does not entail a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to correct mechanistically deviations of monetary growth from the reference value. Rather, monetary developments are thoroughly analysed in relation to the reference value in order to ascertain their implications for the outlook for price stability over the medium term. If threats to price stability are identified by this analysis, monetary policy reacts in a manner appropriate to address these threats. Therefore, while substantial or prolonged deviations of monetary growth from the reference value would, under normal circumstances, signal risks to price stability, there is no automatic relationship between short-run deviations of M3 growth from the reference value and monetary policy decisions. The Governing Council will continue regularly and thoroughly to analyse monetary developments in relation to this reference value and will explain the implications of this analysis for monetary policy decisions to the public. Against this background, the confirmation of the reference value implies the continuation of the pursuit of the monetary policy strategy conducted in the past and does not imply any change to the Governing Council's assessment of the current monetary policy stance.

"568","Indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's tender operations in the year 2000 including an adjustment to smooth the century date change","Indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's tender operations in the year 2000 including an adjustment to smooth the century date change 23 September 1999 The European Central Bank (ECB) is today releasing to the public the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's tender operations in 2000 [annex, pdf 26 kB]. The indicative calendar is prepared in compliance with the procedures set out in the ""General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"" (dated September 1998). The ECB aims at establishing conditions ensuring that counterparties in all Member States can participate in the main and the longer-term refinancing operations. Therefore, when compiling the calendar for these operations, the ECB has made appropriate adjustments to take into account bank holidays in the individual Member States. Attention should be drawn to one particular aspect of the indicative calendar relating to the transition to the year 2000. As already pointed out in a previous press release, the ECB is convinced that the Eurosystem's monetary policy framework is flexible enough and has built-in mechanisms designed to deal with any level of liquidity demand that might arise in the euro markets. In addition different scenarios have been analysed and the conclusion has consistently emerged that the Eurosystem will be in a position to cope with any potential increase in the demand for liquidity: the stock of banknotes held by national central banks is sufficient to allow for a considerable additional demand for banknotes in circulation and the amount of collateral available in the Eurosystem will be sufficient to allow for the corresponding increase of refinancing needs of the banking system. Nonetheless, it is considered prudent to eliminate any potential problem that may derive from the maturing and renewal of a main refinancing operation in the first week of the year 2000. Thus, no new main refinancing operation will be initiated in the first week of the year 2000, and no such operation will mature during this week. In fact the maturity of the main refinancing operation of 21 December 1999 will be lengthened exceptionally to three weeks. To avoid that two main refinancing operations mature on 12 January 2000, the operation of 30 December 1999 will also be lengthened to three weeks. This adaptation, which is consistent with the overall set-up, is considered useful to minimise any potential problem for counterparties and for the financial market, which could result from the conduct and settlement of a large operation directly after the transition to the new century.

Therefore the Eurosystem has clarified to its counterparties that the valid interpretation of the General Documentation allows tender bids not actually covered by collateral at the time of the submission of bids, and just requires the financial capacity to have the collateral on the date of settlement of the tender.

"586","Decisions on ECB interest rates","Decisions on ECB interest rates 21 January 1999 At today's meeting, the Governing Council of the ECB reviewed the monetary, financial and economic situation in the euro area against the background of its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. Taking into account the latest economic developments, the Governing Council confirmed its earlier assessment of the outlook for price stability. The Governing Council therefore decided that for the two main refinancing operations to be settled on 27 January and 3 February 1999 the same conditions will apply as for the three main refinancing operations settled earlier this month, i.e. they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 3.0%. In addition, the Governing Council discussed the interest rates on its two standing facilities. It recalled that it had set the interest rate on the marginal lending facility at 4.5% and the interest rate on the deposit facility at 2% at the start of Stage Three, i.e. 1 January 1999. However, as a transitional measure the marginal lending rate and the deposit rate were set at a level of 3.25% and 2.75%, respectively, for the period from 4 to 21 January 1999. The purpose of the narrow corridor thus established by the interest rates on the standing facilities was to facilitate the transition by market participants to the integrated euro money market during the initial days of Monetary Union. At today's meeting, the Governing Council reviewed the experience with the functioning of the euro area-wide money market since the beginning of the year. It noted that difficulties of some market participants with the functioning of the area-wide money market and, in particular, with the cross-border flow of liquidity, have diminished substantially over time. As a consequence, overall, the integration of the euro area money market has therefore reached a satisfactory state only three weeks after its creation. Against this background, the Governing Council did not see a need for continuing the application of the narrow interest rate corridor beyond the date of 21 January 1999, noting that an extended use of a narrow corridor would be likely to hamper the development of an efficiently functioning money market in the euro area in the longer term. Thus, the Governing Council decided today to revert to the interest rates on the Eurosystem's two standing facilities which it had set for the start of Stage Three, i.e. it set the interest rate for the marginal lending facility at a level of 4.5% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at a level of 2% with effect from 22 January 1999.

"587","The results of the second main refinancing operation of the Eurosystem and information regarding the first longer-term refinancing operations","The results of the second main refinancing operation of the Eurosystem and information regarding the first longer-term refinancing operations 12 January 1999 The second main refinancing operation On 11 January 1999 the Eurosystem announced its second main refinancing operation, which was successfully completed today. The operation, which was conducted by means of reverse transactions at a fixed rate of 3%, has a duration of 14 days, from 13 to 27 January 1999. A total of 1068 banks participated in the operation and submitted bids to the national central banks for an amount of EUR 563 billion. The total amount of liquidity allocated to the banking system amounted to EUR 48 billion, thus resulting in an allotment quota of 8.52%. The maturing on 13 January 1999 of approximately EUR 66 billion of liquidity-providing monetary policy operations that were conducted by national central banks in Stage Two of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was taken into account by the Eurosystem when reaching the allotment decision. The fact that the maturing operations are only partially substituted by the second main refinancing operation takes also into account the volume to be allotted on 13 January 1999 in the first longer-term refinancing operations (see below). The allotment decision was taken on the basis of an analysis of the liquidity conditions in the euro area as a whole, while paying due attention to the uncertainties connected with the phasing-in of the new system. The decision aims at allowing the credit institutions (on aggregate) to follow a smooth path in fulfilling their minimum reserve requirements over the first maintainance period which extends from 1 January 1999 to 23 February 1999. It can be anticipated that, owing to the phasing-in of the Eurosystem's different refinancing operations, the daily aggregate current account holdings of credit institutions on 13 January 1999 will be below the daily average reserve holdings required to meet the estimated reserve requirement of the first maintenance period. The effect of this one daily shortfall in relation to the required daily average will be compensated by the additional liquidity provided through the first longer-term refinancing operation on 14 January 1999. The definitive figure for the aggregate reserve requirement of credit institutions in the euro area will not become available until early February. In order to provide some guidance to the market, on 4 January 1999 the Eurosystem published its estimate of around EUR 100 billion for the aggregate reserve requirement for the first maintenance period. On the basis of the information currently available, it appears likely at present that the definitive figure might be slightly below this estimate, rather than above it. The first longer-term refinancing operations The first longer-term refinancing operation will be announced on 12 January 1999 and will be settled on 14 January 1999. As specified in the ESCB publication entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"", dated September 1998, ""the longer-term refinancing operations are liquidity-providing reverse transactions with a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months. These operations aim to provide counterparties with additional longer-term refinancing and are executed by the national central banks on the basis of standard tenders. In these operations, the ESCB does not, as a rule, intend to send signals to the market and therefore normally acts as a rate taker."" The General Documentation also specifies that ""from time to time, the ECB indicates the operation volume to be allotted in forthcoming"" longer-term refinancing operations. As announced by the Governing Council of the ECB on 22 December 1998, the first longer-term refinancing operations will be conducted by means of variable rate tenders, using the single rate (i.e. Dutch) auction procedure. The phasing-in of the longer-term refinancing operations requires the Eurosystem to conduct parallel tenders with three different maturities (25 February 1999, 25 March 1999 and 29 April 1999). The ECB intends to allot an amount of EUR 15 billion in each of the parallel tenders. The total amount that the ECB intends to allot in these three operations is thus EUR 45 billion. (This compares with EUR 25 billion of liquidity-providing operations conducted by national central banks in Stage Two which mature on the settlement day of this first longer-term refinancing operation.) It should be noted that, in order to allow sufficient time in which to process these three parallel operations, the announcement of the tender results will take place at 1.15 p.m. ECB time (C.E.T.) on 13 January 1999, instead of at 11.15 a.m., which is the announcement time foreseen for the results of all other regular tender operations of the Eurosystem. As regards the subsequent longer-term refinancing operations in the first three months of 1999, the amount the ECB intends to allot will also be EUR 15 billion per operation.

"588","Decisions on ECB interest rates","Decisions on ECB interest rates 7 January 1999 At today's meeting, the Governing Council of the ECB reviewed the monetary, financial and economic situation in the euro area against the background of its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. Taking into account the latest economic developments, the Governing Council confirmed its earlier assessment of the outlook for price stability. The Governing Council therefore decided that for the two main refinancing operations to be announced on 11 January 1999 and 18 January 1999 the same conditions will apply as for the first such operation, which was settled today, i.e. they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 3.0%. The Governing Council confirmed its intention to maintain the main refinancing rate at this level for the foreseeable future. In addition, the Governing Council recalled that the marginal lending rate and the deposit rate were set at levels of 3.25% and 2.75%, respectively, for the period from 4 to 21 January 1999. The Governing Council confirmed its intention to terminate this transitional measure following its next meeting on 21 January 1999. Finally, the Governing Council recalled the decision taken at its meeting on 22 December 1998 that the first longer-term refinancing operation, which will be announced on 12 January 1999 and settled on 14 January 1999, will be conducted as a variable rate tender, using the single rate allotment procedure.

"589","The first main refinancing operation of the Eurosystem","The first main refinancing operation of the Eurosystem 5 January 1999 On 4 January the Eurosystem announced its first main refinancing operation, which was successfully completed today. The operation has a duration of 13 days, from 7 to 20 January 1999. The main refinancing operation was conducted by means of reverse transactions at a fixed rate of 3%, which was pre-announced on 22 December 1998 by the ECB Governing Council. A total of 944 banks participated in the operation and submitted bids to the national central banks for an amount of EUR 482 billion. The total amount of liquidity allocated to the banking system amounted to EUR 75 billion, resulting in an allotment quota of 15.57%. In arriving at the allotment decision, it was considered that credit institutions had accumulated a significant minimum reserve deficit in the first days of Stage Three. The decision to allot EUR 75 billion aims at providing sufficient liquidity to allow credit institutions (on aggregate) to neutralise, relatively soon within the first maintenance period, this reserve deficit. In arriving at the allotment decision, it was also taken into account that a total of EUR 185.1 billion of liquidity-providing monetary policy operations conducted by the national central banks in Stage Two will mature in the first weeks of Stage Three. Of this amount, approximately EUR 75 billion will mature on 7 January 1999 (i.e. the settlement day of today's main refinancing operation). The allotment volume decided today also reflects the expected evolution of autonomous liquidity factors, such as the circulation of banknotes, which are anticipated to provide additional liquidity to the market. The decision has been taken on the basis of an analysis of liquidity conditions in the whole euro area while paying due attention to the uncertainties connected to the phasing-in of the new system.

"591","The ECB interest rates to be applied at the start of Stage Three","The ECB interest rates to be applied at the start of Stage Three 22 December 1998 On 1 January 1999 the ESCB will assume responsibility for defining and implementing the single monetary policy of the euro area. At today's meeting, the Governing Council of the ECB took a decision on the interest rates that will apply to the monetary policy instruments of the ESCB as from the start of Stage Three of EMU. These ECB interest rates will play a key role in signalling the monetary policy stance of the ESCB. In this context, the Governing Council recalled that on 3 December 1998, in a co-ordinated decision, all the national central banks participating in the single monetary policy lowered their key central bank interest rates to 3% (with the exception of the Banca d'Italia, which reduced its discount rate to 3.5%). As explained by the ECB at that time, these decisions were based on a consensus reached in the ECB's Governing Council following a common assessment of the economic, monetary and financial situation in the euro area. The joint reduction in central interest rates had to be seen as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates with which the ESCB will start Stage Three and which it intends to maintain for the foreseeable future. Against this background, the Governing Council decided today to conduct the first main refinancing operation of the ESCB as a fixed rate tender and to set the level of the interest rate for this operation at 3%, in line with the key central bank rates prevailing at the end of Stage Two. With respect to the interest rates on the ESCB's standing facilities, which are designed to form a corridor for movements in short-term money market rates, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate for the marginal lending facility will be set at a level of 4.5% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at a level of 2%. These are the rates of the ESCB's standing facilities at the start of Stage Three, i.e. 1 January 1999. However, as a transitory measure, between 4 January 1999 and 21 January 1999, the interest rate for the marginal lending facility will be set at a level of 3.25% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at a level of 2.75%. This measure aims at smoothing the adaptation of market participants to the integrated euro money market during the initial days of Monetary Union. The Governing Council intends to terminate this transitory measure following its meeting on 21 January 1999. *** Further details of relevance for the submission of bids by counterparties to the first main refinancing operation will be announced on 4 January 1999. The allotment decision of the operation will be made public on 5 January 1999 and settlement will take place on 7 January 1999. The first longer-term refinancing operation will be announced on 12 January 1999. The allotment decision of the operation will be made public on 13 January 1999 and settlement will take place on 14 January 1999. The Governing Council decided today that this operation will be conducted as a variable rate tender, using the single rate auction procedure. In order to guide financial market participants to the new euro money market situation prevailing in Stage Three, some further technical information concerning the liquidity conditions expected at the start of Stage Three is annexed to this press release. ANNEX - Information relating to the liquidity conditions at the start of Stage Three To contribute to a smooth reserve management by credit institutions and to a smooth functioning of the euro area-wide interbank money market at the beginning of Stage Three, the Governing Council of the ECB wishes to draw attention to some features of the liquidity situation prevailing in the first days of Stage Three: The transition to the reserve requirement system of the ESCB is expected to imply that the aggregate reserve holdings of credit institutions might be lower on the first three days of Stage Three than the aggregate reserve requirements to be fulfilled on average within the first maintenance period ending on 23 February 1999. However, the ESCB intends to provide sufficient liquidity in its first regular refinancing operations to allow credit institutions (on aggregate) to neutralise the reserve deficits accumulated in the first days of Stage Three. It should be noted that the precise aggregate reserve requirements relevant in the maintenance period of 1 January 1999 to 23 February 1999 will not be known from 1 January 1999 on, but only in the course of the first maintenance period. The initial distribution of liquidity within the euro area might be uneven. For that case, interbank flows of reserves are anticipated to level the liquidity situation in the euro area from 4 January 1999 on. As a general measure to give orientation to credit institutions in their reserve management, the Governing Council of the ECB has also taken the decision to publish regularly in Stage Three the following information regarding the liquidity conditions in the euro area: the aggregate current account holdings (mainly consisting of minimum reserve holdings) of euro area credit institutions with the ESCB on the preceding ESCB business day; the aggregate use of the standing facilities on the preceding ESCB business day; the aggregate minimum reserve requirement for the current maintenance period; (This figure will be published after the publication of monetary statistics for the same month. In effect, this will be a few days after the start of the maintenance period.) the average aggregate current account holdings (including minimum reserves holdings) of euro area credit institutions in the current maintenance period up to (and including) the preceding ESCB business day. The ECB intends to publish this information by 9.30 a.m. on every ESCB business day. Since the reserve requirements in the first maintenance period will not be known until the end of January 1999, the ECB will provide, in this special case, tentative estimates of the aggregate reserve requirements.

"592","Consolidated balance sheet of the Monetary Financial Institutions sector (September 1997-October 1998) and the broad monetary aggregate M3 (December 1996-October 1998)","Consolidated balance sheet of the Monetary Financial Institutions sector (September 1997-October 1998) and the broad monetary aggregate M3 (December 1996-October 1998) 14 December 1998 The Tables attached to this press release contain the first statistics produced by the European System of Central Banks relating to the consolidated balance sheet of the Monetary Financial Institutions sector (MFI sector) for the euro area and to the broad monetary aggregate M3 derived from this consolidated balance sheet. The data published today reflect the position as of 1 December 1998. Henceforth, these statistics will be updated (including for possible revisions to historical data) and published on a monthly basis. This press release covers the period September 1997-October 1998 for the month-end assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector and the month-end stock of M3 and its components. Furthermore, partly on the basis of estimates, 12-month growth rates of M3 are presented for the period December 1996-October 1998. Although the annual growth rates of M3 must be interpreted with some caution, as these data have a provisional nature, they represent the most reliable and comprehensive current source of monetary information for the euro area. Consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector The consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector (see Table 1, Annex) provides a complete and homogeneous coverage of those financial intermediaries that are considered to be money creating within the euro area. The principal aim is to provide the European Central Bank (ECB) with a comprehensive statistical picture of monetary and financial developments in the euro area and with the basis for the definition and presentation of the monetary aggregates and their counterparts. The consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector is based therefore on the following two main elements: a List of MFIs for statistical purposes. The ECB establishes, updates and publishes on the Internet on a regular basis the List of MFIs for statistical purposes in accordance with harmonised classification principles. Procedures for monitoring and continuous checking ensure that the List of MFIs remains up -to date, accurate, as homogeneous as possible and sufficiently stable for statistical purposes; and a specification of the statistical information reported by these MFIs at monthly and quarterly frequency. The ECB requires statistical information in terms of harmonised instrument/maturity categories, currencies and counterparties. The ECB will compile these aggregates for the euro area as amounts outstanding (stocks) and as flows derived from them. One important aspect is financial innovation, which is itself affected by the development of the Single Market and the move to Monetary Union, both of which affect the characteristics of financial instruments and induce financial institutions to change the focus of their business. The statistical data required to compile the consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector were first defined in the so-called Implementation Package (""Statistical requirements for Stage Three of Monetary Union""), which was made available to reporting agents by the European Monetary Institute and the national central banks in July 1996. Starting from 1 January 1999, the required statistical information will be collected and compiled on the basis of Regulation ECB/1998/16 concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the Monetary Financial Institutions sector (see related press release published on 1 December 1998). Composition of M3 As mentioned in the press release entitled ""The quantitative reference value for monetary growth"" published on 1 December 1998, the broad monetary aggregate M3 consists of currency in circulation (net) plus certain liabilities of MFIs resident in the euro area and, in the case of deposits, the liabilities of some institutions that are part of central government (such as Post Offices and Treasuries). These liabilities included in M3 are: overnight deposits; deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two years; deposits redeemable at notice up to three months; repurchase agreements; debt securities issued with a maturity of up to two years (net); units/shares of money market funds and money market paper (net). Only such positions vis-à-vis euro area residents other than MFIs and central government are included in M3 (see Table 2, Annex). With respect to the components of M3, overnight deposits account for the largest share, namely 31% of M3 in October 1998. The share of deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two years in that month was 20% and that of deposits redeemable at notice up to three months 27% of M3. The weight of both currency in circulation (net) and of unit/shares of money market funds and money market paper (net) was approximately 7%. Among the smaller components, the outstanding stock of repurchase agreements accounted for 5% of M3 in October 1998 and debt securities issued with a maturity of up to two years (net) for 2%. Developments in M3 The monetary aggregate M3 for the euro area grew in October 1998 at an annual rate of 4.8%. This was 0.5 percentage point higher than in September 1998 (4.3%). The moderate increase in the 12-month growth rate of M3 in October 1998 mainly reflected a stronger demand for marketable instruments included in M3, in particular repurchase agreements, units/shares of money market funds and money market paper. The three-month moving average of the 12-month growth rates of M3 in August, September and October 1998 stood at a level of around 4.5%. Taking a longer-term perspective, the available estimates show a steady pace of M3 growth of between 3.5% and 5.5% over the past two years. At its meeting on 1 December 1998, the Governing Council of the ECB concluded that this monetary trend appears to be broadly compatible with continued price stability in the euro area.

"593","Regulation of the European Central Bank on the application of minimum reserves","Regulation of the European Central Bank on the application of minimum reserves 4 December 1998 At its meeting last Tuesday the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) adopted the ""Regulation of the European Central Bank on the application of minimum reserves"". This Regulation lays down in a legally binding text the features of the minimum reserve system of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) presented in the ECB Report entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"" (September 1998) and in the subsequent ECB press release entitled ""The use of a minimum reserve system by the European System of Central Banks in Stage Three: Final specification"" (13 October 1998). The legal basis for the ECB Regulation on the application of minimum reserves is set out in Article 19 of the Statute of the ESCB and in the Council Regulation (EC) No. 2531/98 concerning the application of minimum reserves by the ECB, which was adopted by the ECOFIN on 23 November 1998 and published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 27 November 1998. Article 19 of the Statute of the ESCB entitles the ECB to require credit institutions established in euro area Member States to hold minimum reserves in pursuance of monetary policy objectives. In addition, the aforementioned Council Regulation specifies three aspects of the ESCB's minimum reserve system, namely the reserve base, the maximum permissible reserve ratios and the sanctions to be imposed in cases of non-compliance. All other features of this system may be decided upon by the ECB within the limits set by the Statute of the ESCB and the Council Regulation. Against this background, the ECB Regulation on the application of minimum reserves adopted last Tuesday defines, inter alia, the applicable reserve ratios, the institutions subject to reserve requirements, the calculation of reserve requirements, and the remuneration of holdings of required reserves. The ECB Regulation on the application of minimum reserves ensures that the terms and conditions of the ESCB's minimum reserve system are uniform throughout the euro area and completes the required legislation on this subject. This Regulation will be available in all community languages from the national central banks and the ECB in the coming days and will shortly thereafter be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

"595","The quantitative reference value for monetary growth","The quantitative reference value for monetary growth 1 December 1998 On 13 October 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB announced the main elements of its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. The Governing Council announced its quantitative definition of the ESCB's primary objective, namely price stability. Price stability was defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. Furthermore, the Governing Council outlined the two main elements of the strategy that it will use to achieve the objective of maintaining price stability. First, a prominent role will be assigned to money. This role will be signalled by the announcement of a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate. Second, in parallel with the analysis of developments in the monetary data in relation to the reference value, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and risks to price stability in the euro area will be undertaken. This assessment will encompass a wide range of economic and financial indicator variables. The announcement on 13 October left two issues unresolved, namely the derivation of the reference value for monetary growth and the definition of the specific broad monetary aggregate for which the reference value will be announced. At its meeting on 1 December 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB agreed on these remaining issues regarding the ESCB's monetary policy strategy by specifying the details of the quantitative reference value for monetary growth. The reference value will refer to the broad monetary aggregate M3. M3 will consist of currency in circulation plus certain liabilities of Monetary Financial Institutions (MFIs) resident in the euro area and, in the case of deposits, the liabilities of some institutions that are part of central government (such as Post Offices and Treasuries). These liabilities included in M3 are: overnight deposits; deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two years; deposits redeemable at notice up to three months; repos; debt securities with maturity of up to two years; unit/shares of money market funds and money market paper (net). The reference value for monetary growth must be consistent with - and serve the achievement of - price stability. Deviations of current monetary growth from the reference value would, under normal circumstances, signal risks to price stability. To this end, the reference value must be derived in a manner consistent with the ESCB's quantitative definition of price stability, i.e. that the HICP for the euro area increases at a year-on-year rate of below 2%. Price stability according to this definition is to be maintained over the medium term. Furthermore, the reference value for monetary growth must take into account real GDP growth and changes in the velocity of circulation. In view of the medium-term orientation of monetary policy, it appears appropriate to base the derivation of the reference value on assumptions about the medium-term trend in both real GDP growth and velocity growth. Regarding the trend growth of real GDP in the euro area, a figure is estimated to be in the range of 2% to 2 1/2% per annum. However, non-inflationary growth in the euro area could, in the future, be higher if necessary structural reforms in labour and product markets were realised. Concerning velocity, medium-term trends have to be assessed in the light of the regime shifts and behavioural and institutional changes associated with the convergence towards and transition to Monetary Union. The resulting uncertainties concerning broad money velocity have led to the view that a plausible assumption for the medium-term trend in velocity is a decline in the approximate range between 0.5% and 1% per annum. This assumption is consistent with the historical experience of the last twenty years. The derivation of the reference value is based on the contributions to monetary growth resulting from assumptions made for prices (""year-on-year increases of below 2%""), real GDP growth (trend growth of 2% to 2 1/2% per annum) and velocity (a trend decline in the approximate range between 1/2% and 1% each year). The Governing Council has decided to announce a reference rate for monetary growth, rather than a range. The Council believes that announcing a reference range might be falsely interpreted by the public as implying that interest rates would be changed automatically if monetary growth were to move outside the boundaries of the range. In setting the reference value for monetary growth, the Governing Council emphasised that the ESCB's published definition of price stability limits increases in the HICP for the euro area to ""below 2%"". Furthermore, the actual trend decline in velocity is likely to lie somewhat below the extreme of the range mentioned above. Taking account of these two factors, the Governing Council decided to set the first reference value at 4 1/2%. The ESCB will monitor monetary developments against this reference value on the basis of three-month moving averages of the monthly twelve-month growth rates for M3. This will ensure that erratic monthly outturns in the data do not unduly distort the information contained in the aggregate, thereby reinforcing the medium-term orientation of the reference value. In December 1999, the Governing Council of the ECB will review the reference value for monetary growth.

"596","List of eligible assets","List of eligible assets 23 October 1998 Further to the publication of the European Central Bank (ECB) entitled “ The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures” (the “ General Documentation”) (September 1998), the ECB will publish on Monday, 26 October 1998 at 8 a.m. ECB time (C.E.T.), on the Internet a list of assets eligible for use as collateral in ESCB credit operations (http://www.ecb.europa.eu, item MFIs and assets). For the time being, this service will be accessible from the ECB website on working days from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. ECB time (C.E.T.). Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB requires all ESCB liquidity-providing operations to be based on adequate collateral. With the aim of protecting the ESCB from incurring losses in its monetary policy operations or in the provision of intraday credit in TARGET, ensuring the equal treatment of counterparties and enhancing operational efficiency, underlying assets have to fulfil certain criteria in order to be eligible for ESCB monetary policy operations. These eligibility criteria are laid down in Chapter 6 of the General Documentation. The list of eligible assets shows the underlying assets that are deemed by the ECB to fulfil these eligibility criteria. It is recognised that the harmonisation of eligibility criteria throughout the euro area would contribute to ensuring equal treatment and operational efficiency. At the same time, due attention has to be paid to existing differences in financial structures across the Member States. A distinction is therefore made, essentially for purposes internal to the ESCB, between two categories of assets eligible for ESCB monetary policy operations. These two categories are referred to as “ tier one” and “ tier two” respectively, where: tier one consists of marketable debt instruments which fulfil uniform euro area wide eligibility criteria specified by the ECB; tier two consists of additional assets, marketable and non-marketable, which are of particular importance for national financial markets and banking systems and for which eligibility criteria are established by national central banks, subject to the minimum eligibility criteria established by the ECB. The specific eligibility criteria for tier two applied by the respective national central banks are subject to approval by the ECB. No distinction is made between the two tiers with regard to the quality of the assets and their eligibility for the various types of ESCB monetary policy operations (with the exception that tier two assets are not normally used by the ESCB in outright transactions). At present, the list of eligible assets contains around 19,000 tier one assets and around 1,800 marketable tier two assets. The outstanding value of marketable assets amounts to around €5,000 billion. Non-marketable tier two assets are not included in the list on an asset-by-asset basis. However, the main features of these assets are provided in the database, item User Manual. All assets eligible to be used in monetary policy operations can also be used to collateralise intraday credit in TARGET. In addition, for the collateralisation of intraday credit, TARGET participants may use collateral proposed by EU national central banks of non-participating Members States; EU national central banks in participating Member States can admit such collateral for the purpose of collateralising intraday credit. Such collateral will have the same quality standards as the assets eligible in the euro area. These assets are not included in the list of eligible assets published by the ECB. The list of eligible assets will be updated on the Internet on a weekly basis. The updates will be made available to the public at 8 a.m. ECB time (C.E.T.) each Friday. In addition, the ECB reserves the right to exclude, at any time, individual assets from use in ESCB monetary policy operations.

"597","List of Monetary financial institutions and institutions subject to minimum reserves","List of Monetary financial institutions and institutions subject to minimum reserves 16 October 1998 Further to the publication of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) entitled ""Statistical requirements for Stage Three of Monetary Union (Implementation Package)"" (July 1996) and the publication of the European Central Bank (ECB) entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"" (September 1998), the ECB will publish on Tuesday, 20 October 1998 at 8 a.m. ECB time (C.E.T.), on the Internet a list of monetary financial institutions (MFIs) for statistical purposes and institutions subject to minimum reserves (http://www.ecb.europa.eu, item MFIs and assets). For the time being, this service will be accessible from the ECB website on working days from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. ECB time (C.E.T.). The list of MFIs for statistical purposes will facilitate the production of a comprehensive and consistent balance sheet of the money-creating sector in the euro area and serve other important purposes, such as the European System of Accounts (ESA 95, November 1996). In addition to the national central banks and the ECB, the list includes all credit institutions (as defined in Community law), money market funds and other institutions fulfilling the MFI definition. The list of institutions subject to minimum reserves is based on Article 19.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, which entitles the ECB to require credit institutions established in the euro area to hold minimum reserves in pursuance of monetary policy objectives. This implies that branches in the euro area of entities with no registered office in the euro area are also subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system. No credit institution established in the euro area will be exempt from its obligations under the ESCB's minimum reserve system as from the start of Stage Three. It should be emphasised that only institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system may be eligible to be counterparties to the ESCB's monetary policy operations. Credit institutions are entitled to deduct liabilities held vis-à-vis other institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system from the reserve base to be applied for the calculation of the institution's reserve requirement. The publication of the list of institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system will therefore allow credit institutions to determine the amount of liabilities held vis-à-vis other institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system. The list on the Internet of MFIs for statistical purposes and institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system will be updated on a monthly basis. The updates will be made available to the public on the last business day of each calendar month and will be valid for the calculation of the reserve base of credit institutions for the subsequent maintenance period. Procedures for monitoring and continuous checking have been put in place to ensure that the list remains up to date, accurate and consistent. At the request of reporting agents or the institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system, it will be possible to obtain a hard copy of the list from the national central banks.

"598","A stability-oriented monetary policy strategy for the ESCB","A stability-oriented monetary policy strategy for the ESCB 13 October 1998 1. At its meeting on 13 October 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB agreed on the main elements of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the ESCB. These elements concern: the quantitative definition of the primary objective of the single monetary policy, price stability; a prominent role for money with a reference value for the growth of a monetary aggregate; and a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for future price developments. 2. As mandated by the Treaty establishing the European Community, the maintenance of price stability will be the primary objective of the ESCB. Therefore, the ESCB's monetary policy strategy will focus strictly on this objective. In this context, the Governing Council of the ECB has adopted the following definition: ""Price stability shall be defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%."" Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term. The current rate of HICP inflation in the euro area is in line with this objective. Three features of this definition should be highlighted: The HICP is the most appropriate price measure for the ESCB's definition of price stability. It is the only price index that will be sufficiently harmonised across the euro area at the start of Stage Three; by focusing on the HICP ""for the euro area"", the Governing Council of the ECB makes it clear that it will base its decisions on monetary, economic and financial developments in the euro area as a whole. The single monetary policy will adopt a euro area-wide perspective; it will not react to specific regional or national developments; an ""increase (...) of below 2%"" is very much in line with most current definitions adopted by national central banks in the euro area. Furthermore, the statement that ""price stability is to be maintained over the medium term"" reflects the need for monetary policy to have a forward-looking, medium-term orientation. It also acknowledges the existence of short-term volatility in prices which cannot be controlled by monetary policy. 3. In order to maintain price stability, the Governing Council of the ECB agreed to adopt a monetary policy strategy which will consist of two key elements: money will be assigned a prominent role. This role will be signalled by the announcement of a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate. The reference value will be derived in a manner which is consistent with - and will serve to achieve - price stability. Deviations of current monetary growth from the reference value would, under normal circumstances, signal risks to price stability. The concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment to mechanistically correct deviations over the short term. The relationship between actual monetary growth and the pre-announced reference value will be regularly and thoroughly analysed by the Governing Council of the ECB; the result of this analysis and its impact on monetary policy decisions will be explained to the public. The precise definition of the reference aggregate and the specific value of the quantitative reference value for monetary growth will be announced by the Governing Council of the ECB in December 1998; in parallel with the analysis of monetary growth in relation to the reference value, a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area will play a major role in the ESCB's strategy. This assessment will be made using a wide range of economic and financial variables as indicators for future price developments. 4. This strategy underlines the strong commitment of the Governing Council of the ECB to its primary objective and should facilitate the achievement of this overriding goal. It will also ensure the transparency of the ESCB's decision-making and its accountability. Based on its strategy, the Governing Council of the ECB will inform the public regularly and in detail about its assessment of the monetary, economic and financial situation in the euro area and the reasoning behind its specific policy decisions.

"599","The use of a minimum reserve system by the European System of Central Banks in Stage Three: final specification","The use of a minimum reserve system by the European System of Central Banks in Stage Three: final specification 13 October 1998 On 8 July 1998 the European Central Bank (ECB) announced the main features of the minimum reserve system to be used by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The main features included the range of institutions subject to reserve requirements, the liabilities included in the reserve base, the potential range of the reserve ratio, the introduction of a lump-sum allowance, and the remuneration of reserve holdings. Further details of the minimum reserve system were presented in the recently published ECB report entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"" (September 1998). At its meeting on 13 October 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB discussed the final specifications of some of the remaining open issues regarding the minimum reserve system. The following decisions were taken: The ECB will apply a reserve ratio of 2%. This will refer to the following items of the liability base: overnight deposits; deposits with agreed maturity up to 2 years; deposits redeemable at notice up to 2 years; debt securities issued with agreed maturity up to 2 years; and money market paper. The ECB will allow a lump-sum allowance of €100,000 to be deducted from an institution's reserve requirement. If a credit institution cannot provide evidence of its liabilities in the form of debt securities up to two years and money market paper vis-à-vis other institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system, the ECB will allow the institution to apply a standardised deduction of 10% to the aforementioned liabilities. An ECB Regulation on minimum reserves will be published shortly, which will lay down the features of the ESCB's minimum reserve system in a legally binding text.

"600","The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures","The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures 18 September 1998 The European Central Bank (ECB) will today publish a Report entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"". The Report contains a detailed description of the monetary policy instruments and procedures to be applied by the ESCB in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union. Hence it provides credit institutions with the information they will need in order to prepare for participation in ESCB monetary policy operations as from 1 January 1999. The Report expands upon and updates the material contained in an earlier version published by the European Monetary Institute (EMI) on 23 September 1997. The Report first sets out the criteria to be fulfilled by credit institutions in order to be eligible as counterparties to ESCB monetary policy operations. It then presents the features of the different types of open market operations which might be conducted by the ESCB (the main refinancing operations, the longer-term refinancing operations, fine-tuning operations and structural operations) and the ESCB's two standing facilities (the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility). The Report contains a detailed description of the procedures related to the various types of operations. Furthermore, the Report specifies the eligibility criteria and the risk control measures to be applied to assets underlying the ESCB's liquidity-providing operations. Moreover, the Report describes the features of the ESCB's minimum reserve system. Finally, the Report presents specific provisions to be applied for the ESCB's monetary policy instruments and procedures in the transition to Stage Three. With reference to the EMI publication of September 1997, the present Report specifies additional details, particularly in the following areas: the eligibility criteria and risk control measures to be applied to eligible assets underlying ESCB monetary policy operations have been elaborated, including a specification of the levels of initial margins and valuation haircuts. The lists of eligible assets for ESCB monetary policy operations will be made public by the ECB via the Internet. It is expected that these lists will be published for the first time in October 1998; the time schedule for the procedures to be applied to transactions involving the cross-border use of eligible assets through the correspondent central banking model (CCBM) has been specified. The ECB intends to publish a more detailed description of the procedures for the cross-border use of eligible assets in November 1998; further to the decision taken by the Governing Council of the ECB on 7 July 1998 to implement minimum reserves as from the start of Stage Three, the precise features of the ESCB's minimum reserve system, in particular the definition of the reserve base and the formula for the calculation of the remuneration of holdings of required reserves, are included in the Report. In this respect, it should be noted that the Governing Council of the ECB decided at its meeting on 11 September 1998 to extend the set of liabilities to which a zero reserve ratio will be applied to include deposits redeemable at notice over two years. The ESCB's minimum reserve system applies to credit institutions established in the euro area. The list of institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system will be made public via the Internet. It is expected that this list will be published for the first time in October 1998; the reporting framework for the money and banking statistics of the European Central Bank is presented in Annex 4 of the Report. The statistical reporting framework will be used for the calculation of the reserve base of credit institutions. In this respect, some changes have been incorporated in the statistical reporting framework with a view to making the reporting requirements consistent with the final specification of the reserve base; the tender operations calendar for 1999, which specifies the dates for the ESCB's main refinancing operations and longer-term refinancing operations, is presented in Annex 5 of the Report; the list of wire services to be used by the ESCB in its communication of monetary policy operations to the public is contained in Annex 6 of the Report; the list of securities settlement systems which fulfil the ECB's minimum standards, and the conditions for their use by the ESCB, are listed in Annex 7 of the Report. It should be noted that the Report itself does not confer rights on counterparties. The legal relationship between the ESCB and its counterparties in open market operations and transactions under the standing facilities will be established in the form of appropriate contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the ECB and the national central banks. In the preparation of these contractual and regulatory arrangements, the ESCB is aiming to ensure uniform financial conditions for counterparties across the euro area, taking due account of the existing differences in legal environment between Member States. The legal documentation will be presented to the counterparties by the ECB and the national central banks before the start of Stage Three. The legal basis for the ESCB's minimum reserve system will be laid down in a Council Regulation (EC). Likewise, the powers of the ECB to impose sanctions and its right to collect statistical information will be governed by Council Regulations (EC). These three Council Regulations (EC) have yet to be adopted by the EU Council. The provisions contained in the Report are thus subject to the final wording of the Council Regulations (EC). The legal framework for the ESCB's minimum reserve system and for the statistical reporting framework will be completed in ECB Regulations to be enacted following the adoption of the Council Regulations (EC). The Report will be distributed by the EU national central banks to interested parties in their respective countries.

"601","The use of a minimum reserve system by the European System of Central Banks in stage three","The use of a minimum reserve system by the European System of Central Banks in stage three 8 July 1998 At its meeting on 7 July 1998 the Governing Council of the European Central Bank finalised its recommendation for a Council Regulation (EU) on the application of minimum reserves by the European Central Bank (ECB). This Regulation will set the framework for the main features of any minimum reserve system that may be used by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) in Stage Three. At the same meeting, the Governing Council also discussed the actual use and specification of an ESCB minimum reserve system at the start of Stage Three of Monetary Union. The Governing Council sees three main functions which a minimum reserve system could usefully perform in Stage Three. First, it may contribute to the stabilisation of money market interest rates. Second, such a system will contribute to enlarging the demand for central bank money and thus creating or enlarging a structural liquidity shortage in the market; this is considered helpful in order to improve the ability of the ESCB to operate efficiently as a supplier of liquidity and, in the longer term, to react to new payment technologies such as the development of electronic money. Third, the ESCB's minimum reserve system may also contribute to controlling the expansion of monetary aggregates by increasing the interest rate elasticity of money demand. The Governing Council attaches particularly high importance to the performance of the first two of these functions, which relate to the management of money markets. Without the use of a minimum reserve system, the ESCB would be faced with a relatively high volatility of money market interest rates, which would require the frequent use of open market operations for fine-tuning purposes. Such a situation would have clear disadvantages in practical terms and could undermine the operational efficiency of monetary policy as central bank signals may become blurred if markets have difficulty in distinguishing policy signals from technical adjustments. By reducing the need for central bank intervention in the market, a minimum reserve system will allow the ESCB to extract valuable information from market developments. Furthermore, the Governing Council regards it as necessary to employ minimum reserves to influence the structural money market situation in the euro area, thereby safeguarding the role of national central banks as providers of liquidity to the banking system. The Governing Council is conscious that introducing a minimum reserve system has to be seen in the light of the potential burden which it imposes on the private sector and the effects it might have on the financial activity of credit institutions in the euro area. Against this background, the Governing Council intends to implement a minimum reserve system as from the start of Stage Three which will be designed primarily to fulfil the two money market management purposes outlined above, while at the same time allowing an adequate remuneration of minimum reserves. The following features are foreseen for the ESCB's minimum reserve system: 1. Range of institutions In accordance with Article 19.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, the ECB will require, at the start of Stage Three, credit institutions (as defined in Article 1 of the First Banking Co-ordination Directive) which are established in the euro area to hold minimum reserves on accounts with the national central banks. 2. Liability base The ECB intends to include in the reserve base the liability categories ""deposits"", ""debt securities issued"" and ""money market paper"" as defined in its framework for the collection of money and banking statistics. Interbank liabilities and liabilities vis-à-vis the ESCB will not be subject to reserve requirements. Furthermore, a zero reserve ratio will be applied on ""repos"", ""deposits with an agreed maturity of more than two years"" and ""debt securities with an agreed maturity of more than two years"". 3. Reserve ratios The ESCB will apply a reserve ratio in a range of between 1.5% and 2.5% of the relevant items of the liability base. A ratio in this range is deemed necessary in order to ensure that the desirable money market management functions can be performed. At the same time, such a ratio would be sufficiently low so as not to impose any undesirable rigidity on the asset structure of credit institutions. 4. Lump-sum allowance The ECB will permit a lump-sum allowance of the order of EUR 100,000 to be deducted from an institution's reserve requirement, so that credit institutions with a small reserve base will not have to hold minimum reserves. 5. Remuneration The ECB will remunerate minimum reserve holdings at a level corresponding to the rate of its main refinancing operations. In practice, the remuneration will be calculated as the average, over the maintainance period, of the ESCB's rate (weighted according to the number of calendar days) on its main refinancing operations. The remuneration will be paid on the first business day following the end of the maintainance period over which the remuneration was earned. 6. Other features Further details of the minimum reserve system will be applied as already specified in previous documents published by the European Monetary Institute (EMI), in particular in the report entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"" (September 1997). The Governing Council intends to decide on the exact specification of the minimum reserve system in November 1998 at the latest. This decision will be based on the early data from the new system for money and banking statistics. It is intended that the precise features of the minimum reserve system will be published in the form of an ECB Regulation CONTACT European Central Bank Directorate General CommunicationsSonnemannstrasse 20 60314 Frankfurt am Main, Germany+49 69 1344 7455media@ecb.europa.eu Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.
